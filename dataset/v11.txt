off withlocationapple in india is located in two majorcities try and guess which two majorcities i am talking about here i'll giveyou three seconds go in the commentsection and write down your guessesthreetwoone the answers are hyderabad inbangalore i am absolutely certain thatmost of you would have guested hyderabadin bangalore anyways however yes applehas a bigger presence in hyderabad thanin bangalore with respect to tech andtech related fields talking aboutwhether or not apple is a remote firstcompany the answer is no sadly apple isnot a remote first company at the momenthowever yes due to pandemic it isoperating in complete work from homehowever once pandemic finishes which wehope that it happens fast you will berequested to report back to your baselocations which in this case will behyderabad or bangalore talking aboutinternational relocations in apple yesthere are provisions with which you canget transferred to overseas offices beit in europe or usa however the numberof such instancesso if you are someone who is looking towork in let's say usa for matteri would strongly suggest againstapplying or joining apple at the momentat this time apple is actively hiring aswell as looking to expandthe following rules for which there areactive job openings in apple's courierwebsite are software engineering dataengineering devops solution architectboth in the engineering as well as themanagement track talking about the techstack of appletypically speaking from a backendperspective generally the backendlanguage that they prefer are javascaleor python for their relational databaseusage they prefer oracle db for nosqlusage they prefer mongodb andelasticsearchfor their big data needs they use hadoopspark and scyf for their cloud needsthey use aws and needless to say youwill be building somevery highly distributed systems henceyou will be actively working onmicroservices and service orientedarchitecture now coming to benefits iwould not say that apple has someindustry leading benefits but they dohave some decent benefits that theyoffer to their employees for exampleeach and every year you will get around250 dollars that you can spend onpurchasing any apple product not onlythis for every year you get 125 percentdiscount as well as multiple 15 discountflat on the dealer price on any appleproduct that can also be combined withthe above 250 dollar cash to purchase itapart from it you also get a verylucrative employee stock purchase planunder which you get 15 percent discounton the apple stock to purchasein addition to whatever stock you getup to 10 percent of your base salary youget german wellness reimbursements youget internet reimbursements and freesnacks however in apple you do not getfree food for that matter the followingtheme has its presence in indianumber one is isnt t number two is adsnumber three isapple maps and number four is point ofsale team out of these four teams isn'tthas the largest presence in indiahowever very unfortunately according tothe internal employees that work inapple india they say that isnt t is notsuch a good team to join the work-lifebalance the work culturethe type of work all three are quite badin ict so if you are contemplating toapply in apple then i would suggest thattry to avoid isntp in general as much aspossible there are few teams under theisnt umbrella that are working oncutting-edge projects machine learningand ai but from an overall view the workculture and work-life balance isextremely questionable and bad in icphiring at apple is extremelydecentralized in nature and it is verymuch team dependent there is no standardbar per se hence whenever you do decideto change teams you need to mandatory gothrough a completeloopevery time and since there is nostandard per se into hiring practicesthe number of rounds the type of roundswhat all will be expected in theserounds also vary by a huge margintypically speaking they do ask questionsaround dsa system design as well ascomputer fundamentals in theirinterviews general level that has beenobserved in apple interviews is that thelevel is typically lesser than that ofitsother counterparts that are present inthe country and outside from a levelperspective nothing more than lee codemedium is expectedin the dsa interviews and generallyspeaking the system design interviewsand apple are on the easier sideincrements at apple are quite less theyvary between the range of five percentand at max 14 percent on a yearly basishoweverone very good thing about apple is thatthey give outa huge number ofstocksas performance tied incentive to you inthe form of refreshers so if you performwell you tend to get a lot more stockson a year-to-year basis it will bearound 30 to 40 percent of your newhigher stock grant that will again westfor the next four years so this isdefinitely a very good thing about applecoming to compensation structurecompensation structure at apple isfairly similar to any other company forthat matter they have the base salarywhich is the salary that you geton a monthly basis they havethe new higher stock grant which isbasically a stock grant that is given toyou number of stocks is issued to youwhich rests in the next four years theyhave performance bonus which isbasically a percentage bonus on top ofyour base salary which you get on thebasis of how you perform in oneparticular year and on top of it theyhave joining bonus but yes in thecompensation calculation we will not beconsidering joining bonus for thatmatter because they areextremely random and there is no methodto the madness here or usuyou will also get refreshers which isbasically again performance basedadditional stocks that is given everyyear the additional stocks will also begiven you 25 each year for thewe will be discussing about the exactsalary details at sd1 sd2 and sd3 levelso let's start with sd1 the years ofexperience required to get hired at sd1level is less than three years ofexperience the base salary range variesbetween 15.5 lakhs per year to somewherearound 20 lakhs per year the performancebonus varies between five percent toaround 10 percent and the new higherstock grant varies between 40 lakhs to60 lakhs for four years the yearly totalcompensation will vary between 26.5lakhs per year to around 33 lakhs peryear for sde-1 coming to the sd roll thebase salary varies between somewherearound 25 lakhs to around 35 lakhs peryearthe performance bonus is again 5 to 10percent per yearon top of it you get the new higherstock grant which varies between 60lakhs to around 90 lakhs for one year soall in all as an sd2 you can expect toearn somewhere between 40 lakhs toaround 60 lakhs as your yearly salarythe years of experience required to gethired at apple as an sd2 is anywheremore than three years of experience nowcoming to sd3 the use of experiencerequired to get hired at hd 3 level isanywhere more than 7 years of experiencethe base salary range varies between 40lakhs per year to around 60 lakhs peryear the performance bonus variesbetween 10 to 20of uh the particular base salary for oneparticular year the new higher stockgrant is somewhere between 80 lakhs forthe next four years to around 1.6 croresfor the next four years so all in all asan sd3 at apple you can expect to earnsomewhere between 65 lakhs per year toaround 1.1 crore per yearyes you can see from this fact that thesd1 salaries or salaries at lower levelin apple is quite competitive and maybeeven more than your average company outthere however as you progress inside oras you get hired at higher levels thesalary typically is lower than what youcan expect at companies of this staturein other companies all in all in the endi would say that definitely apple is agood company as a company it has immensebrand value and as a company in yourresume your resume will get all theboost that you can hope forhowever inside apple india because of alarge presence of isntp org the workculture the work the type of work aswell as work life balance is not gooddefinitely you can consider apple asyour companyto apply as well as go intogiven the correct team and the correctwork apart from this in apple you alsodo not get good opportunities totransfer abroad so i would definitelydefinitely say that keep all thesethings in mind wheneveryou make the decision that you want to ireally
