witha quick presentation where rich is goingto talk for the next 15 to 20 minutesand afterwards we're going to switch toa q a session so you'll have theopportunity to askrich questions tomorrow one of ourattendees has a job interview scheduledwith apple so he'll get the opportunityto ask richone questionlet's get started richawesome thanks desi yeah hi everyonethank you all for taking some time outof your day to join us here thisafternoon uh or this morning dependingwhere you are in the world like this hementioned my name is rich hutton uh i'ma coach on carris uh specializing inbehavioral interviewing and offernegotiationsum i have been a former hiring managerand recruiter at companies like appleibm a company called gartner as well uhand so today like you mentioned whatwe're going to be doing is we're goingto be kind of giving you a briefoverview of some of the three key thingsthat you need to be aware of and to bevery mindful of when it comes tobehavioral interviewsnowadays basically every company in theworld in some way shape or form has abehavioral interview part of theirhiring process even for more technicalpositions think data scientists dataanalysts etc um they all have it in someway shape or form where they admit to itand they said openly hey this is abehavioral interview or if they're justlooking at it passively while you knowjust having a general conversation withyou these are all things that they'relooking for so in terms of talkingpoints right why are you guys here todayultimately hopefully you're here ifyou're wondering you know is there asecret tip to being successful in aninterview has it been a while uh sinceyou last interviewed maybe you neededkind of a brush up a refresher so tospeak um are you just generally curiousabout what fang and for those who don'tknow fang being facebook amazon applenetflix and google companies are lookingfor in behavioral interviews and just asaside this applies to all of thecompanies as well um are you worried uhthat you might have some technicalexpertise but can't quite get yourmessage across to the hiring manager umall of these things are completely validquestions which a lot of people askclients that i have asked in somebehavioral interview training andthey're all very valid rightthis is not something which is a perfectscience i have yet to out ofthousands of candidates i've spoken withfound anyone who is perfect atbehavioral interviewing i'm not perfectwhen i interview uh for roles uh i'llfully admit to that but the reality isthat through practice through gettinghelp with a coach through understandingthese three principles that we're gonnatalk through today this is gonna makeyou feel more confident hopefully at theend of it um and hopefully it'llactually encourage you to actually seekout and get a coach uh coaches can besuper helpful um they are great safeplaces to practice to get feedbackwithout jeopardizing potentially yourfuture job right during an interview soreally encourage everyone here to atleast have an introductory call withmyself or any other of the great coachesum that we have uh on karisso like i said three key things thatwe're gonna be talking about today hereum so if you want to go to the nextslide here are what we're looking at uhthe three keythree keys to success sound obviousbutthe reality is in my experiencea lot of people don't do them very wellright so let's start off with here thatyou got answering the questiondelivering confidently and less is moresowhat do they mean well in a nutshellanswering the question again it soundsfairly obvious but to a lot of peopleit's actually harder than it seems a lotof times people will over analyze thequestion they will think themselves ohit's a it's a trick question um i don'treally i know what they're asking fori'm gonna go down this long rabbit holehere of um you know telling about mylife story i'm going to talk non-stopfor seven minutes about how great of acandidate i am and why they shouldobviously choose methat is not usually the best way toapproach this and so we're going to diginto that a little bit moresecond one is delivering confidently umideally in a structured manner sohopefully some of you may be familiarwith or have heard about the startechnique for for answering questions sosituation task action result there areother variations of this as well par isanother one that i've heard of beforeproblem issueaction result etc so we're going to talka little bit about kind of what astructuredanswer actually looks likeand then less is moreless is more is i would say 98 99 of allthe candidates i work with all thecandidates i've ever spoken with franklyhave an issue when it comes to being toolong-winded uhyou you think that the entire purpose isto tell as much as you possibly can tothe interviewers about yourself aboutyour experiencesthe reality is you actually want to tokeep that quite condensed because youwant to create a little bit of curiosityin yourself and you want them to ask youadditional follow-up questions and sowe'll kind of dig into that a little bitmoreas well so if you want to go to the nextslide herewe're going to talk a little bit aboutthe interview right what is thebehavioral interview what is the processhere well hiring is a matching game anduh kudos and shout out to another greatcoach on the platform uh teresa fung whowho kind of put this slide together foranother webinar that we did previouslythe reality is hereunderstanding what hiring is it is amatching game in terms of what the uhthe hiring manager what the recruiterwhoever it is that is out has the openposition is looking for and whether ornot you have those experiences and againthis sounds really obvious but you'd besurprised at how many peopledo not understand that this is whatwe're actually looking for heremost of the needs that you are going toneed to talk about or express most theneeds that the hiring manager is lookingfor that you need to talk about andexpress and show that you haveexperiences in are in the jobdescriptionread the job description again thissounds like oh yeah bell rich why didi'm here at a webinar to hear you tellme to read the job description wellbecause job descriptions actually get alot more information than a lot ofcandidates realizeand if you apply to a role and you don'thavesome most of half of the things thatthey're looking for in the jobdescription they're not going to getback to you why well right now themarketplace is a really hot candidatemarketplace that means that there's alot of people looking for a lot of rolesout there and therefore you know ipersonally and when i had a role open uhrelatively recently in four days i hadover 600 applicants for a positionas a recruiteri really at times don't have the time togo through all 600 applicants andchances are when i find someone thatactually has exactly what i need i'mgoing to talk to them because i have alot of candidates to look for versussomeone who only has half of what i needso all this is to say it's reallyimportant to actually read the jobdescription understand the jobdescription and be prepared to speak toall of the bullet points or topics thatthey are talking about in that jobdescription it takes time it takeseffort but it's really going to help youstand out when looking at all the othercandidatesbut there are other things thataren't in the job description thathiring managers and recruiters i'm justgoing tobucket those together and call them theinterviewers are looking for these canbe things like your ability to actuallycommunicate your experiencescan you build rapport in the interviewand in the conversation prime example uhit happens way too often but i'll youknow welcome to a conversation hi myname is rich how are you doing today i'mgoodand it's like qriketsokay well immediately if i'm looking forsomeone who can communicate i'm kind ofput off because you're not building anyrapport even if you're nervous even ifyou're unsure still make the effortthese are things which aren't in the jobdescription but i guarantee you thathiring managers and interviewers areactually looking forthey also might be looking for thingslike being able to ask some deep andchallenging questions are you curious doyou like to learn new things and soagain these aren't necessarily thingsthat are going to be the third bulletpoint in the job description but youneed to be aware of these things youneed to make sure that you have theability to say okay well they'reprobably going to want someone curiousbecause apple's a really curious companythey're very innovative they're good atproblem solving maybe i should take alittle bit extra time to prepare somegreat questions to ask the interviewerum during the conversationso these are just kind of some of thethings just to overall think about whenit comes to to hiring right and in abehavioral interview so if we go to thenext slidelet's now dig intoto the uhmy favorite one frankly which is uhanswering the question right and andmaking sure that you are truly able tofigure out what it is they're askingfrom you and that you give an answerthat they are looking forso these are some examples here of ofquestions that uh i have had experiencewith with candidates saying that theyget stumped by they have no idea how toanswer them ori'll ask this question as like abenchmark to my candidates when i firstmeet the more clients even when i firstmeet them and get a sense of kind ofwhat their reaction is so let's startoff with the first one rightwhy apple sothis again it sounds prettystraightforward or why any other companyfor that matter it sounds prettystraightforward right so i had acandidate to kind of share an experiencewith you i had candidate not long agowho who told me that this is a questionthat they're very well prepared for so isaid great awesome let's go for it mockinterview why do you want to join ushere at apple why apple why this companyand they started off by telling me howthey had 15 years of experience in thisindustry why he's the best candidate forthe role how's he how he's increasedproductivity by 25 percent that's notthe question that's nothing to do withthe question that i asked the person itwaswhyapple the question is why do you want towork for apple why have you chosen outof all the companies that there are tochoose from why are you sitting in frontof me today for an interview for appletherefore your answer should probably bevery specific to why you're choosing tospeak with us an interview here at applehow do you do this make it personalright tie it into the core beliefs andfundamentals of apple as an organizationagain for an example here what do youknow about apple wallet we all know it'sa very innovative companythey put the client at the center oftheir universe their products and theirsoftware so the hardware and softwaremerges together to create an experiencesowhat do you believe in in terms of thesame ethics that they do do you also putthe client at the center of youruniverse and whatever it is that you'redoing do you also love the way in whichthey protect privacy and that they arekind of going against the trend of justusing data for advertising and marketingperspectives things like thatreally speak to why it is that you arewanting to work for apple specificallynot all about your backgrounds andthings like thatsothe other thing to think about here isgoogle is a great place uh and i don'tmean that to work but it is uh but i'mtalking about you know the actual searchcapabilities the internet let's justcall it is a great placedo not google searchhow should i answer why apple click onthe first result and then use that asyour answer i guarantee you there'sprobably 5 000 other people who aredoing the exact same thing and all theeffort that you put into doing theresearch is going to go to nothing rightmake it truly personal to yourselfbecause at the end of the day when youthink about apple as a company it's apersonal company they want to trulyunderstand and change your life that iswhy i joined apple that is theexperience i had at apple that isprobably why you want to join apple sotalk about that rightnext one why this role again believe itor not this question is still not askingabout you i do not want to hear aboutall your years of experiences right offthe bat at leastthis is a question which is checking tounderstand what research have you doneabout this position have you read thejob description which hopefully becausei told you to you're now going out andall reading the job descriptions of theroles that you're applying forhave you looked into the company morethan just surface level do youunderstand how this role ties into thegreater ecosystem of the organizationthis is what they're looking for nowthis is very different though to theprior question which was why applethat is asking about why the companythis is saying now what do you knowabout this role and out of the12 000 positions that are open at appleright now that's the guess i don't knowhow many there arewhy are you choosing this one versusthat one so this is now really where youwant to highlight your research andskills and the effort that you've doneto understand this position a productmanager at splunk is different from aproduct manager at apple which isdifferent from a product manager atgoogle believe it or not that is whatthey're looking for here so what would agood answer to this question look likeumyou know i'm really interested in thisrole because based on what i've read andfound in my researchthis is a leadership role which cantruly transform the way we do businesswith our end user clients the fact thatthis role sits in between uh ourmarketing and our procurementorganizations means that there'll bemultiple competing stakeholders alllooking for different ways to do workbutgiven my prior five years experienceworking exclusively within the marketingthe procurement space i believe that myability to manage uh you know the seniorstakeholders in an organization likethis will make me a great asset to thisrole however having said that and basedon all the research that i've alreadydone i would still really like to usethis opportunity and listen to you tolearn a little bit more about the roleokay so that has proven that you've donethe research that's proven that you'vekind of taken the step a little bitfurther and you're trying to understandthe position where it sits in theorganization you're not just someonewho's hit applyand then just kind of walked away fromthe position that's really important sohopefully you guys are kind of getting asense of where i'm leading to here rightthese questions are actually black andwhite for the most part it's justpeople tend to over complicate them ornot think or think that we're trying toask a trick question when we're reallynot the next one and i know this is theslide i'm going to take the longest onbut there's a reason because it's themost importantwhat are your weaknessesthis is a question that challenges somany people specifically thoseindividuals who come from backgrounds oreven cultures wherethey might not think it's appropriate toactually highlight your deficiencies uhto highlight your weaknesses what you'renot very good at but what we're actuallylooking for here is we're looking for asan interview your ability to bevulnerable your ability to be humbleyour ability to umshowcase a skill or a competency orability that you've actually worked hardon improving because at one pointanother you weren't actually that goodat itso guess what you need to do for thisyou need to actually tell them what yourweaknesses are this is not the time whenyou say actually no i don't have anyweaknesses i'm actually pretty good atmy job you're going to come acrossarrogant uh the hiring manager isprobably going to think oh you thinkyou're better than me um you're notgoing to come across like you'revulnerable at all the reality is youactually want to showcase the fact thatyou know not everyone is perfect youknow that you have things to work on andfor bonus points you want to highlightwhat you have actually improved uponyou know for me uhone of my biggest weaknesses wasactually you know going uh twoheadstrong into conversations with mystakeholders i would just go in with asolution uh and sometimes i kind ofjumped the gun and it would mean that wewould get something wrong down the lineand have to go back and start all overagain but what i can tell you is um youknow recently i've been trying to reallyslow down my approach make sure i'masking a lot of deep questions to kindof understand what is it that thestakeholders are truly looking fortaking some time processing that andtaking a little bit longer to thenpresent a better solution than justgoing headstrong and the reality is i'veactually done that and you know here'san example actually of a time where i'vebeen able to do this brieflythere you go right you've been able toshowcase a weakness and at the same timehighlight an area where you have been uhimproving uponi hope that's helpful does the anyquestions that have come through so farthat i can help kind oftake off the plate yeah in fact thereare a few questions that i thinkfit really well this slide withquestions everyone ignore what you'reseeing right now uh it's the next slidei'm gonna switch toquestions we've already received in thechatso let me just make sure i'm not missinganybodyfrom your point of view richwhat is the most complicated behavioralquestion to answerummost complicatedthat's a good question uh i'd say themost complicated behavioral any questionto ask answer is umwhy are you looking to make a move fromyour current companythis is one that actually does take alittle bit of practice and thought interms of how you craft your answer lookwe all know reasons why people leaveright you don't like your boss um you'vebeen passed up for promotionum the company's kind of looking alittle shaky right now you're not quiteconvinced you're gonna be there for along period of timeso so these arethis is a question where you don'tnecessarily want to lead with theblunt truth shall we say you don't wantto go into an interview and saying ireally don't like my boss they're notvery nice to me i don't get on well withthem you don't want to go thataggressive but what you probably do wantto do is you want to think about thegreater pictureand how you tell your story and so forthat example right let's say you're notgetting along well with your boss rightyour boss is micromanaging you somethinglike that your answer to that questioncould be well you know right now kind ofthe way in which i'm seeing the cultureof my current organization just doesn'treally match up with what i feel i needto be the most productive or the mostefficient version of myself you knowwhat i'm really looking for is i'mlooking for an organization which has xor ynowinclude x or y as being some of the keythings you know about the company thatyou're interviewing with you're going toget immediate brownie points right so ifi use apple there as an example it's youknow i'm just really not i'm not likingthe way in which my company is goingforward with their approach to toprivacy and to to kind of putting thecustomer first but i know at apple thoseare two key core fundamentals that youdo and then you build a culture aroundthat right or you know you build aculture around internal growth andpromotion the leaders are all promotedfrom within so they kind of get a senseof what i will truly be doing day in dayout and i think for me that's a more youknow inspiring work uh place environmentto be withinyou're still answering the questionyou're still highlighting the fact thatright now in your role it's not the bestplace for you to be um but you're justnot saying directly i don't like workingfor my boss uh he or she is not a veryum nice personi hope that answers that question foryouumthank you so much uh rich justuh as we keep getting more questions andthe time is moving and i know there willbe a lot more questions coming your wayi would say uh we probably need to tryand give likequick answers uh obviously uhwe should do our best to provide maximumvalueyeah that's fine let's go let's uh let'sgo to the next one because i think i canprobably leave some of these questionsto the end then so let's go to the nextslide which is talking more about theformat right uh and the delivery of theactual answers themselves so look at thestars right let's talk about the thestar format situation task and searchresultthis isso important to do and this is somethingwherearguably you're not going to be able totruly master or get really good at thiswithout the help ofsomeone who knows what they're doingwithout the help of a coach or a friendwho's a recruiter something like thatyou want your answers to be natural youwant your answers to be authentic andtrue to yourself but they need to bestructured they need to be structuredbecause at the end of the day in abehavioral interview i'm looking tounderstand your experience what did yougo through what did you do what was theend result so what was your situationand the task what was your action whatwas the end result and you want todeliver this in aclear concise manner which ideally has astrong result because as a hiringmanager when i'm typing down your notesor type down my notes from thisconversation i really want to make surei'm understanding the key points why wasthis a tough situation for youwhat did you do and what are the endresults if i don't understand that thesituation is tough the result doesn'tsound as good if i don't understand whatyou did well then how do i know you'regoing to do the same thing in my companyand then you're maybe just not veryarticulate or you actually didn't doanything at all and if there's no endresultwell what happened like you may havedone all these things but did theproject still faildid it actually really annoyed the theclient or a customer and ended up beinga complete disaster so that's why it'sreally important to understand theformat the first thing i recommendpeople do is write out your answerswrite out your answers put it you knows-t-a-r what was my situationwhat was the task that i had toultimately dowhat did i do and what was the result ifpossible make the results metric basednumbers are easy for pretty mucheveryone to understand you improvedsomething by 20that's better than what it was it's 20betteryou saved 100 millionor 10 million or 500 000these are good things i understand thatversus oh the process got a littlebetterwhat does that meanmy version of a little better might bevery different from your version of alittle better soso try writing out your your yourquestion or your answers or yourexperiences that you want to call uponwrite them all out and then justverbally practice them right talk themout loud get a mirror uh record yourselfon the phone actually say it out loudand see if it makes sense does it soundright does it flow well if you're notsure go to keras and book a coachbecause they're going to tell you oneway or another whether or not it's agood answer or not but it's reallyimportant you get practice doing thisbut and the biggest caveat to this is donot over practice do not have uh youryour screen when you're on an interviewwith just a script and then you knowyour resume and then do not read off thescript we can tell by we i meaninterviewers we can tell when you'rereading off a script pretty easilyit's not going to sound genuine it's notgoing to sound authentic and ultimatelyif i ask a follow-up question and you'renot prepared for that question you'regoing to go from real slick smoothanswer touh uh i don't um wellsoso i don'tit's gonna be really really obviouspractice is so so so key here and thisthen follows up to the next slide herewhich is the last of the three pillarswhich is all about less is morethis is something which like i mentionedat the top of the conversationso many people struggle with again youare not alone if it's you if you knowthat you struggle with this great if youdon't think you struggle with it nooffense you probably do um and here'swhy it's important to get this partrightias a recruiter as an interviewer youhave my attention for about 30 to 45seconds truly that's what it is if i'mnotcurious in that time frame of what youranswer is how you're delivering it to mei am going to tune out and it's notbecause i'm a mean person or because i'munfair or anything like that it's justbecause that to me is a red flag thatyou cannot get your message across to mein a short period of time or that theactual answer that you're giving is nota very good one so you have that timeperiod to get my attentionon the flip side you do not want to keeptalking at me with an eight-minutemonologue of why you love apple so muchwhy apple's the greatest thing in theworld how it saved so many people'slives et cetera et ceterayou know if i work for apple i know it'sa great company i don't need you to tellme for eight minutes why it's such agreat company the sweet spot here issomewhere between one to two two and ahalf minutes that's what you should bereally aiming for in terms of length ofyour answer guess what you have to doyou've got to practice you've got towrite it on your answer and you've gotto speak to it at someone uh or timeyourself right we've all got phones thathave stop watches on them right timeyourself say okay this is now too longuh i need to shave up some bits use yourcoach hey can i practice an answer withyou can you give me your thoughts in themoment that's what we're here for thisis what we dohere's why though uh when you thinkabout thethe logic of an interview why it'simportant that less is morelet's say your interview is an hour longthe entire purpose of the interview isfor me to ask as many questions aspossible of you to understand if you aregoing to be a great fit for my teamif i do not have the opportunity to askyou as many questions as possible youthen have aless chance a worse chance of me seeingyou as being a great fit for my team ifyou talk for eight minutes around whyapple is so great why you're such aperfect fit et cetera et cetera etceteraum well and we use the rule of thumb oftwo minutes is a good answer lengththat's six minutes of time which i nowhave lost to ask you questions to findout if you are a good candidate that'salso you losing six minutes of time uhbeing able to prove that you are goingto be a great candidate for thisposition as well so every minute trulydoes count in a situation like this andso that is why practice makes perfectwhatever way or or or approach you takejust try it out write something down andyou're going to be surprised how long itisyour answer and that's why you knowgetting the coaching support um againdoing it with a friend whatever it iscan help you save you know literallyminutes which can ultimately allow youmore of an opportunity to prove yourselfas to why you are such a great candidateum for this positionspeaking of me talking a lot we'retalking a lotthose are uh in a nutshell the three keythings which i recommend listen we couldtalk for this for hours literally that'smy job to talk for hours around the keyelements which you might need support onthe key elements that you can kind ofget assistance with why coaches aregreat etc etc um but those are three keythings which i really recommend everyoneso take to heart and think about andthese are the key fundamentals thatevery single coach on the carousplatform is going to be able to help youwith whether it's a behavioral interviewor frankly even a more technical onethey're going to be able to help you andthen more so right so certain coacheswill be able to give you like myselfoffer negotiation uh help to get you 1020 more uh in your offercertain coaches who have been formerrecruiters are going to be able to guideyou through the actual recruitingprocess how many times might you go ohi've not heard back in 24 hours what doi do that's what your coach is there forthat's why you can talk to them and saywhat do i do how do i approach thesituationthese are all the great things thatcoaches can provide to you uh but againthese three topic areas are basicallywhat every coach including myself aregoing to be really kind of stressingupon um upon you uh when it comes togetting prepared for your next interviewso you've heard me so much yeah time toactually thank you so much you you'vereally promoted umkeras and ourcoaches and i think it's time to promoteyouum[Laughter]yeah i'm gonna allow myself to promoteuh rich right now um there is a limitedtime offer foreveryone who is joining us and we'll bewatching this live uh also everyone whowatches the recordinghe only has 10 spots available for thispackage rich i'm gonna give you anopportunity to let them know what whatwhat they can take advantage of yeahthank you so so like i said uh we've gota a limited time offer 10 slotsavailable i promise you these are notmarketing techniques it's actually trueuh i do have a another day job that i douh as my day job and this is kind ofwhat i do for fun and just to helppeople out on the side so there's only acertain amount of clients that i cantake on at one time period um so withthese 10 slots essentially what you'regetting is you're getting me as yourcoach right i've been a recruiter asenior recruiter a team lead a hiringmanager i now manage a team ofrecruitersyou get all my expertise that comesalong with this you get insights intothe current labor market understandingokay what sort of job should i really belooking for what are your estimations interms of what the salary or compensationcould behow do i approach this conversationet cetera et cetera then you also getthree 60-minute virtual sessions with mewhere we practice everything that i'vejust talked about right we practice youranswering questions your delivery yourstar methodology your timing and anyother questions that you haveand i'll also include in that a fullresume review so this gives you them theconfidence to know that okay my resumeis actually good right it looks good umthere's a whole i can do a whole otherwebinar on um the falsities that peoplesay about oh how do you get past the atstracking system and things like thatit's really very simple on how to dothat so that's included to this as wellbut ultimatelywhat you get out of this more thananything else is confidence you're gonnaget the confidence that you know thatyou're actually gonna be probably in thetop five percent of candidates that areactually out there seeking help that areseeking coaching support to get betterat what it is that they're doingif we were having this conversation idon't know three five years ago you'dprobably be in the one percent now moreand more people are getting coaches tohelp them so you're still gonna be inthe top five percent but more and morepeople are getting this so you want tomake sure you're the best candidate whena recruiter speaks to our hiring managerspeaks to you this is why you know umpeople who have the experience likemyself can be really valuable to you soyeah so like like this you mentionedi've got 10 of these thoughts availableum you can check out my profileon on the keras website i'm surethere'll be some links to that sent outand the follow-up emails and emailblasts um you can see some reviews ontheredon't just look at myself though makesure you look at other coaches as welland there's a reason for this i don'tspecialize in technical interviewingsupport so if you need uh guidance onhow to be a greatyou know coding interviewer when itcomes to your data scientist interviewi'm probably not the best person to askthat to but when it comes to behavioralinterviewing i have quite a bit ofexperience through this and i canguarantee that you'll be more confidentgoing into those interviewsthank you so much and here's thefavorite part uhi'm gonna stop sharing my screen so thatyou can actually seeus betterand i'llhave a look at the questionshow is everyone doingi guess everyone is excited to ask theirquestions per person i would like toadvise you to please ask just onequestion we are likely not going to beable to answer all of the questions inthe live eventitself but rich how about thiseveryone that actually joined us todaywhat if wedon't get a chance to answer all thequestionsuh what if we offer them a follow-upuhwritten reply to some of the questionsyeah i'll do an i'll do a written faqthat's totally fine yeah we can collectthe questions and do that i'm happy todo that there's not the ones i'm seeingthere's not too many we can kind ofwhittle through some of these prettyfast so i think we'll be okay yeah itjust depends how many uh more questionswe're going to get as the eventprogresses as the workshop progressessoi can see regression's question we gottaanswer rajesh's question he was the onethat we said we were gonna do it so igotta answer it i'm sorry yeahone second i'm gonna do the questionsfor you i actually let me seei see one from him yeahumeveryone we're going to give a chance toreject uhright now because i'm sure he's prettyexcited tomorrow is his interview atapple what kind of role are you applyingfor rajeshwould begood to knowsohere his question ishow should i answer the question whyshould we hire yougood questionsoi guess this goes back tobeing able to tell your story uhand and showcasingwhy you truly passionately believe thisis going to be a great role for youright sowhy should we hire you well because youknow i really believe in this company ibelieve in the work that you're doing ibelieve in you know this role i havethis many years of experience in thispositionum you knowmy experience doing x and yit's not a trick question right it'struly why do you want the job and youhave to talk about your strengths inthat way just as humbly as you can talkabout your weaknesses don't go in theresaying because i'm the best datascientist in the world that you'll eversee but you want to be able to say wellyou know what you know this is why i'mpassionately applying for this rolebecause i believe on my experiencesdoing this doing that because i'velooked at your job description you'retelling me you're looking for a b c dand e guess what i've got a b c d and eand i can include f on that as wellreally simply just make sure you'reunderstanding what the job is andspeakingto that answer it's again it's one thatpeople try to overthink but it shouldjust be authentic and passionate aroundwhat your reason is why they believethat you're a great candidatei thinkhe said uh customer support okay sodevops ooh devops okay yeah so customersupport engineer right think about thisit's it's a role which focuses on theclient or the customer at the end of theday right and you're developing newthings and you're engineering new thingsto help them so you probably want thisrole because you like helping people ismy guess so that should be your leadingtalking point why should i hire youbecause i love helping people because ilovecreating new platforms and newtechnologies or finding ways in whichpeople can get the help which they needfaster or more efficiently or whateverit is hopefully those are your reasonsso just talk about them right just tellthem on your reason as to why that's thecasehopefully that helpsgreat thank you so much umand another one i'm going to readstraight away um so question is thereany key decision making question thatmight result in no go independently onother questions answersis there any key decision makingquestion that might result in a no-goumthere's a few uh i would actually saythey're probablymore there are fewer questions that willresult in an automatic no-go as it isbehavioral things that we see in aninterview soum i mean the weakness one is one if youcome and say i don't have any weaknessesoh that's a no-go you you're not you'renot perfect superman's not perfect noone's perfect right so that means you'renot humble that means you're notself-aware that means you literally havenever maybe you don't perceive yourselfas ever having failed in life when weall have failed at something um that isprobably an automatic no-goumbut you know from a skills perspectiveuh your inability to communicate againyour inability to build rapport yourinability tomake me want to talk to you frankly ummost companies now are looking for acompetency that is it's called a varietyof different things some companies callit executive presence um something whichcalled communications um it'sessentially your your ability toactually communicate and if the probablythe number one biggest turn off is yourresume can be great you could be the thebestumyou know the best customer supportengineer right in the entire world uhbut if you if i can't have aconversation with youi'm not going to want to hire you uhbecause we all work in a world now wherewe have to communicate with other peopleuh and so that's just so important socommunication not showing weakness beingarrogant even in sales roles i've hiredfor loads of sales positions and youthink sales type a alpha personalities iwant someone who's a go-getter i do wantthat but i want someone who's also goingto learn from their mistakes and who'sgoing to be humble in how they approachsome things so i think those are some ofthe key things to look out for uh whenit comes tokey decision making you know questionsumbut again it's almost less of a questionmore of how do i see you and view you inthe actual interview itselfa good questionthanks rich and we have another onewhich i'm wondering if we don't want toturn into a kind of written reply ori don't know maybe you want to write ablog post even on this topic can youoffer a couple of additional examples onon how to answer the weakness questionso this is this onewho's asking thisi apologize i forgot the name wrongtheregenboy yeah[Music]the fact that you're asking thatquestion makes me think that you're alittle bit maybe apprehensive aboutgiving an honest truth around what yourweaknesses arethe best way to answer that question isto be very authentic and honest aboutwhat your weaknesses are right you wantto always make sure that whateverweakness you say that there has beensome sort of work or improvement basedon that right so it's not just i'mterrible at time managementokay well i don't want to hire youi was reallystruggling with time management with myclients and stakeholders for a number ofyears but i went out and sought thatfeedback around what i could do to getbetter and it was actually a mentor ofmine who said hey you know what you'relike you're just kind of all over theplace you're a little scattered you're alittle bit sore the other here's sometips and tricks that you should use toget better and so i've been followingthose tips and tricks and you know i canhonestly say it's not maybe a strengthyet but i'm much better at timemanagement than it was in the pastthat's a good way of sharing thatbut it has to be authentic don't makesomething up on the spot please don'tmake something up on the spot because ifi'm going to ask you follow-up questionsand you can't answer my follow-upquestions i'm going to know you made itup on the spot um but yeah i'll i'll putpen to paper on some more of those uhbecause that could definitely be um ablog or a follow-up faq questionyeah i think so i think so and right nowwe're actually featuring blog postsquite a bit we have a new contentcreator who's supporting all of you guysthe coaches so you're going to receivehelp from a professionalcontent creatorpleaseanswer this question in detail in a blogpost for us would be great for everyonehere and everyone who joined garrus overthe next few months so next oneuh how should we answer where do you seeyourself in the next five yearswellwhere do you want to be in five yearsright what are your goals do you want tobe a leader do you want to be a subjectmatter expert in your fieldagain whatever your answer whatever yourbeliefs are that's the answer so youknow for me if someone was to ask methis question it would be you know i'dlove to be in a position where i cantruly help as many people grow anddevelop as humanly possible while at thesame time you know gaining the theskills and experiences that i need tochallenge myself mentallythat's my answer because it's deeplypersonal to me or where i want to be infive yearsthings to avoid for this question wouldbe well i'd love to get the experiencehere for two years then leave to go toteslathat would be a bad example of how notto answer that question umuh your pay and pto are great so i justwant to make the most of this while ican before i go somewhere else anotherbad way of doing it but there's probablya you probably have a life goal youprobably have an idea of where you wantto be in a dream state within five yearsthat's your answer right talk about itagainbe yourself that's the probably forgeteverything else i've said for the lasthour being yourself is the mostimportant thing and if you're beingyourself these answers are going to comemuch more naturally to you uh in termsof being able to deliver themconfidentlyand for a hiring manager say that'sgreat why do you want to grow anddevelop people why do you want to whyare you in rajesh i saw that you saidyou're customer obsessed which i loveand apple will love that by the way umwhy are you customer obsessed oh so infive years you still want to be doingthe same job but you know just beingbetter at it great that's totally finebelieve it or not i literallyinterviewed a candidate today who uhmentioned you know i really actuallydon't want to get into leadership i justwant to get loads of more experiencesand be the best you know position uhperson that i possibly can be that'sawesome i i'm i'm i want to hire someonelike that that to me means a lot i don'tneed someone to say i want to be adirector i want a vp i want to do this iwon't do that just be authentic toyourself and be truthfulyou're mutedthank youumwe have likemore than 10 questions for sure andyeah i i expected that that's what'sgoing to happenuh let's try to answer a couple more andthe rest i guess uh we'll have toprovide a written reply to and of courseanyone can actually get a chance to meetrich for15-minute free callbefore deciding to book a package you'reoffering the free calls right rich i amoffering the free calls i i do want tothere is one question here which i thinkis super important that i want to makesure i talk to um and it's notspecifically related to behavioralinterviews but umit isuhsanat kumar i apologize if i got yourname wrong um but the question ishow should you how should you answerumquestions on diversity and inclusion asa hiring manager how do you make sureyou're getting diversity candidates i'mpreparing for engineering manager rolesgreat rolesand i find this topic very very delicateit is a delicate topic right there is noway around this butas a hiring manager i am one right nowcurrentlythere are certain things that you cancontrol and certain things that youcan't control the biggest thing that youcan control when it comes to beingaware and making sure that you are beingopen to diverseand inclusive talent is by removing thebiases that you may or may not have uhit's the biggest reason whyum well it's one of the biggest reasonswhy a lot of companies have diversityissues is because a lot of peopleunfortunately have a bias whether it'sconscious or unconscious they have abias so the first step is understandingthat you may or may not have a bias andthen working to remove that particularbias there are certain industries wherethe this pure statistics and the datashows that there might be moremale candidates than female candidatesor moreindian candidates versus asiancandidates right there there are justthere are realities that we have to facebut in order to be inclusive hiringmanagers we have to make sure that weare removing bias from all of ourconversations soyou knowpreparing for a conversation like thator interview where that is brought upthat is the important things you youjust want to be very matter-of-fact andthat now it is important that we areremoving barriers to entry for all typesof candidates no matter race creedsexuality or things like that but beingvery open and honest about saying heyyou know what there are problems outthere but myself i try to remove any andall biases for my conversationthat i think is gonna you knowshowcase you as a strong and impartialcandidate for a role that might have todo i'm hiring so i just wanted to makesure i talked about that it's a reallyreally good questionyou're mutedthanks rich i just shared in the chatthe questions that we are
