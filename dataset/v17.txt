it doesn't matter how qualified you arehow well your interview wentor what it is you specifically do if youdo not get this question rightwhen you interview with apple you willnot get the jobso it doesn't matter what you do doesn'tmatter the role you were interviewingfor whether that's a software engineeror you're an in-store specialistgenius bar marketing recruiter itdoesn't matterand every single one of those interviewsthey're going to ask you the followinginterview question and the expectationis you crush itthat question is why apple it isprobably the most important interviewquestion you're going to get asked whenyou're interviewing with applenow i have done a few different how toland a job with applevideos and in all of those in the fullguides where i talk about the values andquestions you might answer in theprocessone thing has consistently happenedpeople have gone into the comments andthey've said to meben thank you for that why apple prepbecause that was a keyum so time and time again people aregoing back and they're saying this wasasked inevery single type of role people arewatching it they're getting that answerand they're doing well because they areprepared to answer itbut in my previous videos i've onlytalked about the theory i've talkedabout the questions and saying heythis is how you could probably go aboutdoing that but today i'm doing somethingdifferenti am going to answer it for you i amactually going to give you foursample answers and all four of thesewill help youabsolutely crush it so stay around tothe end because by the end of this videoyou're not just gonna have one two orthree you're gonna have four great waysto answer the most important interviewquestion you will get asked as apotential apple employeenow the first thing i want to talk aboutis the 50 50 rule because it isincredibly importantthe 50 50 rule is a rule that i made upbut i specifically made it up whenyou're answering interview questionslike thisso anytime a company says to you whyapple or why tesla or whygm why any company for that matter itneeds to be 50about the company so it can be a varietyof thingsuh that are tied with the with thecompany the other 50it has to be about the role specificallyand if you can do those two thingseffectively you will absolutely crushthis interview questionnow i'm going to jump into some specificexamples that you can useduring your interview the first examplei'm going to useis the product answer so this is ananswer in which you talk in the firsthalf about the products and how youbelieve in themand then the second half you're going tobe talking about the specific role nowin this examplei'm going to pretend like i am applyingfor a recruiting manager roleuh because that is what i do butwhatever the role it is that you'regoing to beapplying and interviewing for just makesure you specifically talk about thatrolei would pick a few of the top bulletpoints in terms of job responsibilityand speak to those because those areprominentactivities or responsibilities you'regoing to have in the role butthe first answer let's talk about theproductsso i want to work at apple for a fewreasons but one of the things that hasreally inspired me to pursue thisopportunityis i am passionate about the products ihave been using apple products for yearsi have had three or four iphones overthe course of my lifei also love the apple watch and i lovethe way they seamlessly work togetherso working for a company where i ampassionate about the productsand the way they seamlessly worktogether to me is something that i wouldlove to doit's great to know that you can standbehind the products that you're workingtowards creatingnow as a recruiting manager i would feela lot of responsibility because i knowthat i am directly impacting thoseproductsi am going out and i am finding thosepeople i am working with my recruitersto help them be as effectiveas possible and bringing people in sofor right now at this stage in my careeri would love the opportunity to work fora company i am passionate aboutand move into a role that is perfect formy skills and education and this rolespecificallyis in perfect alignment so what i didthere was i talked about the foundationof whythe products i stand behind them i'mpassionate about them and i'd love torepresent them in the capacitythat i'm interviewing for and then italked a little bit about the rolei'll be at a very high level talkingabout how this is goodit's a good fit for me i would becontributing to those productsand for right now for this stage of mycareer it is an excellent fitthat's example one now the next thingi'm going to do is i'm going to give youexample 2and i'm going to specifically be talkingabout innovation soapple being an incredibly innovativecompanythis is an easy one this is low-hangingfruit but i'll be doing this one as ifi'm a software developerwell i would love the idea of working atapple and and for a few reasons so firstand foremostapple to me has always been one of themost innovative companiesaround so as i was going through as iwas getting my degreeit was a company i kept an eye on i'vealways been really interested about whatyou were doing what you were coming outwithand the the quality of the softwaredevelopmentnow for me i would love the opportunityto contribute to thatlike i said when i was getting my degreei was always kind of paying attention toapple and what apple was doing and thequality of the products that they werereleasingthis role specifically is in perfectalignment with what i've gone to schoolfor and what i gotmy internship in a lot of the samecoding languagesum a lot of the the same guidelinessay something better than that um butit's in perfect alignmentwith what i'd like to be doing in mycareer so having the opportunity to notonly use the technology i've been goingto school forbut do it for a company like apple whichis so innovative and is always at thebleeding edge of technologywould be amazing that is why i'm sointerested in working in appleso there you go um i am not a softwareengineer so some of that middle partabout why this specific jobcould be good for you you can probablydo that a little bit betterbut what i did was i talked about howinnovative the company was and how i'vebeen watching them for a whilethen i talked about how the role wasgreat for me and it was in strongalignment to the technology i wasspecifically going to school forand then i finally wrapped up withsaying working with a company on thebleeding edge of technologywould be perfect and would be motivatingand that's why i'm interested in applenow the next one is valuesum this is another really good onebecause when you wereinterviewing with apple you're nottypically going to be differentiatingyourselfwith your education experience andskills because everybody who isinterviewing with appleis smart skilled highly educatedthat's almost a wash so one of the waysthat you can differentiate yourselfis on value so they've got a handful ofvalues they've got accessibilityeducation environment inclusion anddiversityprivacy racial equity justice andsupplier relations you can find that ontheir website but here's my advice whenthey ask you why applepick out one of these values that meansa lot to you and answer it like that sowhy apple well i'm interested in applefor a variety of reasons this positioni feel is a really good fit for me butthere are a lot of roles out there inthe market that i feel are a great fitbut what i can't find everywhere is astrong value alignment i would feel withappleone of the things i found inspiring wheni was doing my research on applewas their commitment to inclusion anddiversity i feel like there's not enoughof that in techso finding an organization that not onlystands behind that but puts that frontand center on their web page as one oftheir valuesreally speaks to me so again this rolethis role is perfect for me this is whati've been working to in my career forthe last four or five years and i feel iwould be incredibly effective at itbut specifically doing it for apple thatreally values inclusion and diversityi would be extremely motivated to takethis roleso what i did there again was i spoke tohow good of a fit the role ishow i've been working towards that in mycareer and then i talked aboutinclusion and diversity specifically intech because i don't know if they do agreat job of thatyet i know there are a lot of companiesworking towards that but specificallyhighlightingtheir value let's know a few things oneyou're in value alignmenttwo you did the necessary research tocome in and be preparednot just to do this job but to do thisjob for apple and why you are a fit froma values perspectivethat's a really great way to answer thisquestion now the last example i want todo here is if you are working in storebecauseworking in store they're still going toask you this question they're going toask you this question no matter butno matter what um but let's say you'reworking in store we're gonna do twothings here we're gonna talk about thecompanyspecifically the products because itwill um i think it goes hand in handto the second half of this answer whichis helping people rightbecause you're going to be in store someof the things they value is people withpersonalitypeople who are well informed and peoplewho are approachableyou need to remember that if you wereinterviewing in store with appleum but let's jump into this this exampleherewhy apple well i'm interested in applefor a few reasons butfor me um i have always beena massive fan of the products i happentolove my ipad and i have a macbook proum in addition to that i also have anapple watch and an iphone so i feel likefor some timei've been a brand advocate so gettingthe opportunity to do thisfor a living and to actually serve applein the way i feel that apple's productshave served mewould be incredibly rewarding inaddition to thati have always been a real serviceoriented person who's customer facingit really invigorates me to help peoplewith their problems so just froma role perspective for what i would bedoing on a day-to-day basisi would find this to be incrediblymotivating to solve problems for peopleto have people come to meand not really know what they need butfor me the expert to be able to guidethem and help them find the product thatis best for themi would find that to be incrediblyrewardingand there you go what i did there was italked about how you love the productsand see how i specifically said you hadseveral of them um if you do don't saythat unless you do but if you do haveseveral of themspeaking to how you have actually goneout and you've purchased and you believein these products and you stand behindthese productsthat's going to position you well andthen talking about how you weremotivatedby the specific task you were going tobe doing in the joband how that would invigorate you giveyou energy and you talked about bothsolving problemsand helping people identify the right umproducts for them which are basicallylike two of the main things you might bedoingum in the store that is a solid way toanswer this questionso there you have it that's why appleany four of these will probablyabsolutely crush it and serve as amassive differentiatorespecially if you're in store if you'rein store and you're doing one of thosegroup interview sessionsand they ask everybody why apple andeverybody else has a run-of-the-millanswer but you come out with one ofthese quite frankly you could use thelast one but any of the other oneswould probably suffice here too it'sgoing to be a great wayfor you to just separate yourself fromthe pack and absolutely crush thisinterview question and again if you cananswerany of these questions with like an aplus answerthis is the one to do it good luck inyour interview you got this[Music]you
