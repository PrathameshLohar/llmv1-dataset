of this video for our tips onoptimizing your Apple internships searchand how you can make yourself stand outI was an engineering project managementintern working on the Macintosh team foreight months in 2017 from January of thesecond semester of my sophomore year incollege through the end of that summer Iinterned there and I lived in acorporate housing complex with threeother interns in Cupertino Californiaand next summer I'll be interning as anengineering project manager on Applewatch and when I got my internship I wasin my first semester of my junior yearof college from a young age both Andrewand I knew that we really wanted to workat Apple mainly because their productswere inspirational they showed us whatcould happen when a group of smartpeople come and work together and theyalso introduced us to this mysteriousfield called engineering we had beenwatching their product releases in fullsince middle school so to say thatworking at Apple was a dream would be abit of an understatement the good thingwas that it was a dream we identifiedvery early on in order to make thisdream a reality starting in our freshmanyear of college we attended all eventsthat Apple came to on campus and theyactually came to a lot career fairstalks with their engineers summernetworking events at Apple's main campusin a variety of smaller events at thetime if you couldn't tell we reallywanted to work at Apple by the end offreshman year as a result of beingregulars at Apple events the recruitersknew as well so mark you said that yougot your internship during yoursophomore year what did you do from theend of freshman year to sophomore yearto get that internship pad to the flyand I applied through just about everychannel that I can find Berkeley has acareer website called handshake I flythrough there I applied on the Applejobs website in person at career fairsat networking events etc but the avenuethat actually worked for me was throughBerkeley's career website handshake Iapplied to a project managementinternship through that platform and Iwas selected for an interview thatsounds awesome but also reallynerve-racking how did you prepare forthat interview and what did they ask youwere there any brain teasers or anythinglikeso it was exciting and it was reallynerve-wracking but luckily there were nobrain teasers this was a phone interviewwith the person that would eventuallybecome my manager and they went down myresume asking for information aboutrelevant experience and some moregenerally behavioral questions why Iwanted to work at Apple and things ofthat sortso what happened after that luckily Iwas selected for a second interview andthis turned out to be my final roundinterview it was held on campus in thecafe in Apple's main campus in CupertinoCalifornia I was going to school inBerkeley but the interview was inCupertino so in order to get there sinceI didn't have a car I took a veryexpensive uber I was also really nervousabout being late so I arrived two hoursearly which if you are wondering is tooearly I would only recommend arrivingabout 15 minutes early otherwise you'llbe waiting there for a long time myfinal round interview was with mymanager and my senior manager and againthere were no brain teasers but theyasked me similar sorts of questions tothe first interview but more in-depth sothey went through my resume again theyasked about how I build relationshipsbecause that was important to the roleand they asked how my friends family androommates would describe me in a fewwords a few weeks later I heard overemail that I was selected for thisinternship position at Apple and I wasjust ecstatic I eventually got the finalletter in the mail and it was in thisreally nice white package with silverembossed writing and an Apple logo andit said welcome to Apple and it hadeverything that I needed to get startedwith becoming an intern at this companyI went on to have an incredibleinternship experience where I had anamazing team I met really friendly andsmart interns from across the world andwill definitely treasure this internshipexperience and my first major internshipbut enough about me on to Andrew Andrewwill be interning at Apple next summerso let's ask him Andrew how did you getyour internship there so last summer Iwas interning at a high-growth techcompany in the Bay Area and I was doingmechanical engineering for that companyand I liked it but for the next summer Iwanted a role that combined bothengineering and business since I amstudying both also wanted to experiencea different company's culture like Marksaid and also a company that was at adifferent stage in growth mark passed myresume around at Apple I had two phoneinterviews no on-campus visit this timeand I got my offersounds pretty straightforward but we allknow that the internship search is notthat straightforward so what do youthink made you stand out against theother applicants you were being comparedagainst I can only speculate but I thinkmy educational background in bothmechanical engineering and businessreally helped me stand out because it isa pretty unique combination and thereason I say this is because the roleI'm doing is engineering projectmanagement for the product design ofApple watch so my educational backgroundfits that really well but I think peopleare really curious about the actualcontent of the internship the perks topay what it was like what you wereworking on mark can you tell us anythingabout that yes and no the person of paywhat I will say are very similar to whatis posted online on websites likeGlassdoor and there are a few articlesout there that say what it's like to bean intern at Apple but I signed anondisclosure agreement so I can'treally go into that too much and theinternship experience I worked onprojects that had impact on the realworld so that was really exciting for meso you said great things about the Appleinternship but you won't be going backnext summer why you're right I had agreat time at Apple but I have a fewinternships left before I graduate fromcollege and I really wanted toexperience another company their cultureand what it was like to work in adifferent location so I'm doing thatnext summer at Microsoft and I reallywanted to get this other experiencebefore I decided what I want to do rightafter college in a full-time job
