[Music]hello everyone we are back with anotherround of duty mock interview series andi am jose tecla deaf during and i'm frommontreal canada and at tutting i work onthe hiring the best engineers by helpingwith the vetting process and i have morethan 17 years of experience and myexpertise lies in javascript and today iwill be interviewing icarmer for therole of an experienced ios developer souh let's get started with this okay sohigher camera for the falluh i'm glad to see you here okay um soi'd like to hear a little bit more aboutyou could you please tell me a littlebit more about your experience and yourpast projects uh and what kind oflanguage and framework are you familiarwiththanks it's nice to meet you josei haveover 11 years of experience in iosdevelopmentsince 2011 i have worked on all kinds ofother stuff which may be extended tosocial medialikehighlighted apps and video calling chatapps and food reviewand i have been working as a freelancersince the start of my career so being afreelancer you have the liberty to workon anything sometimes it's a yourclient's requirements sometimes you wantto do something so apart from iosdevelopment i also work on android andsome web front end uh and back-end aswell but my courser strength is hasalways been ios so uh i have done someinteresting projects that i like themostmy most recent one was with acrowdfunding app it's a fintech basedstartup and that that is in saudi arabiaand i have the liberty to have i have achance to develop that all the apps likethere were three apps that i havebrought there it was very challenging aswell because for infinite apps you haveto take off all the securities and allthe majors thatyou have to make sure that your appworks runs smoothly on all the devicesand like that plus i have alsoexperienced in the game development aswelland game development is alwayschallenging so you have to take care ofso many things and there's a physicsinvolved with math involved there's uiand any mission involvedi likeall those thingsnice nice nice really nice soumquick question okayuh why should we use ios over like nighthybrid uhuh hybrid language like react native oryeah flutteri think uh native give you more abilityto control the device i mean hybrids onekind of there's a layer between hybridframework and the native oh sothere are always some translations goingon so and plus if there's let's sayapple releases something or changingsomething you have that available nativeimmediately but for the uh hybridframework you have to either you have towait till thedev uh release some update or if youhave uh with black native reflector youhave this absolute ability to use nativecode when when needed sobut uhpersonally i like native environmentsbecause you have the direct approach tothe device frameworks and everything sothat's that's what i think maybe uhother some there are people thathybrid approaches over native but for meit's always negativeyeah yeah that makes sense yeah it'smuch the answer great so let's talk alittle bit more about ios developmentokayum what do you understand by codesigning for ios appsof courseit's a requirement from apple uh thedeveloper has to sign their app uh xcodeuse a digital identity to sign the appwhen during the building process uh theidentity is a public private key pairand a certificate applies to thecertificate that holds the public keyfor that and it has uh apples to makesure that that is designed by some andit's some legal entitythat the code has not been changedsince it is signedplusonly the executable code is signed imean if there are images or other nibfiles report files they are never signedbut only theexecutable part of the code is signed sothat way uh it's one way of making surethatapp is notusing any private framework but theyreview it as well and to make sure thatuh the developer has a bullet station itcan be installed on the devicesgot it all right so and let's talk alittle bit more about uh storage andpersistent code or data okay whatoptions umwhat options do you havefor implementing storage and persistingon iosuh generally there areuh many ways of storing data like someother in-memory arrays uh likedictionaries and structures that areperfectly for storing data immediatelyand it is now persistent and it has alife cycleand then there are ns user defaults orin software if we call it user defaultsand we can store the time keychain uh ifit is not structurally complex orwe don't need to run any queries on itso it can be stored in user defaultsit's up to us if we can store encrypteddata in user default or we can store uhplain but in keychain it's alwaysencryptedand then we can uh write or read datafrom thefrom disk or files as well and then ifthere's uhstructure data is available when we havedifferent queries or perform anyoperation and if it's just simple we canuse store data and then there are thirdparty frameworks available as wellunless such likely on and that isadjacent based storage but ifif you think that uh your data iscomplex and you have to run complexquerieson it then you can use sqlite directlyand implement it in your own wayall right greatuh and let'slet me ask about security issues okay isthere any secured issue regarding inmemory arrays orin nsu user default or file risk sowhich one do you recommend to useuh if it's the sensitive data i wouldsay it should be shown in kitchenbecause it is on managed by os itselfand all the critical information isstored in there so if someone breaks itit means that something is wrong withiosthey have to sort it out but yeahalwaysthensensitive information should always goto teachingall rightthat's a good tip okay that's a greattip soall right let's move on okayuh what's the difference between a statkey variable and uh over a classvariableum static and class variables uh firstof all let me tell they are both insimilar in a way that they can on thatcan be attached to a class other thanclass instance and they're different ina way that static is a constant i meanyou defineonce you define it you cannot neverchange it even if youusethere is a parent relationship between aclass a variable is defined as static ina parent and in child you cannotoverride it but for a class if avariable is a class typeso it can be overwritten in theclassesright and when would you use uh categoryover in high dance and vice versauh categories uhwe can add any functionsto existing uhclasses or available it's resources butin categories we cannot add data wecannot work with data so if there isanything if you are adding a functionthat changes the rate of that clause orworks with data you should useinheritance but if you're just addingsome functionality like some just someruntime calculations and you are notshowing anything getting that fineall right greatumokay one more question so what do youunderstand okay by the differencebetween classes over structuresokay like first of all if you are usingobjectivity then struct is not a way togo because that if it does not supportwhat structsthey are introduced in script and thekey differences are thatyou can inherit from class rightyou can add functionality to existingclasses and then classes can beinitialized because they are referencetype they are not value types thirdwe can use identity operator between twoclasses that we can compare if twoobjects are exactly the same they havesame variable and same propertiesall right could we create functionsinside the structuresfunctions and methodsyeah we can we can definitely uh createfunctions andif there is a function is trying tochange data within the struct of its ownthen we have to define that as amutating because structs are value typeso we have to define is the mutating butyeah we can just overall if you lookover broad general picture the classesand structure sports dancing butthat is our kind of an upper handbecause we can inherit andas i said we can upgrade uh apply otheroptionsall right so one more question aboutthis when should we use classesand when should you should we usestructuresyeah well like i said uh if if you havea code that has the perhaps objective cand swift then you you have to go withclasses because theobject does not have struct and then ifwe have to like uhthere's achance that we we cannot use value typeof instances when we have to useelectron cycle that we can if we changesomething at one point the chain shouldbe reflected to another instance as wellthat is inert by some other uh use bysome other object so which is classes aswell and if we have something like wehave tosometimes we have to uhuh differentiate the differentiators iftwo objects are same or not we have touse glassesnice structures not supported energyupdate nice nice nice all right so umjust to let you know i use thisstructure extracted tosend data by um cdl communication thatwill be that is very easy to communicatebetween two device using serialcommunication you can send a structureand in the other hand you just need tohave the structure itself and then whenyou load it boom you have everything setup that's really easy tosend data between two devicesyeah and struct uhthankfully apple's introduced i meanstrip well well when i started knowingthat you see we don't have that libertynice all rightall right uh so one more question so howhow to create an abstract class inobjective cuh objective c does not have that spotout of the boxbut it does not like limit us we do notcreate one so we can likedefine object class and then force otherclasses or otherchildren or any classes that areinherited to it touh those methods because we can addexceptions we can raise exception if theif some class does not overwrite aspecific method we can just throw anexception and make sure that every classfollows the same ruleokayokay sowhat are the difference uh did weimplement a property with dynamic or ascene sizethere they both are aware to define aproperty but when you use synthesizewith the property it means that eitheryou are providing data and setterof the property or system will do ityourself but if you are defining aproperty with dynamic keyword it meansthat at some point maybe some otherclassat runtime the getter center will betherenot immediately but yeah at one time itwill be available it's kind of a promiseto the system that i'm not providing atthe saturday yet but yeah i willeventuallyokayall right great so i'd like to call uponour uh senior developers that arewatching this video so if you would liketo have would like to work with ios ifyou have experience with ios uh you cango to tutin.com jobs okay search forjobs for ios you can apply for thosejobs uh if you are not you can sign upat tuning and go to the vetting processand once you clean the vet process youyou'll find a job as as we did okay as ikarma and i did soumall right so just go ahead turin.comsless jobs and apply for the jobs thatyou want okay also tell me in thecomment section below what kind of mockinterviews would like to see in theupcoming videoand give a thumbs up for this video anddon't forget to subscribe to our channelforuhbe updated with the next video okaylet's go back to you uh our camera so uhwhat do you understand by quality ofservices in gcduh quality service uh it is there toimprove our app just like applyencourage us if we use if we write acode that is battery efficient memoryefficient it is responsive it does notblock the ui and let the user have asmooth experience so there are some kindof uh active qrs available for our forus to use and some are like userinteractive uh we use it for animationsand ui updationsand then the user initiative type uh itis used for tasks like loading data fromapi and well it prevents data from userdoes not have an interaction with it butit's the kind of just loading stuffand it's a utility type which is usedfor data tracking that is not for dataloading that is not tracked by the userand then there's a background type ifit'sused for tasks like saving data to localdatabase or anything that is not highpriority and we just want to do it inbackgroundit does not affect anythingall right okayand how do we handle okay how do wehandle conclusions in iosuh congruence there aretwo types that are async or synctype of your site so andif you see that asynchronous the coderuns on the background track andcontrols return to its images uh as soonas the finish or the task is finishedthe control is done to the main threadui is not blocked and because it'sconcurrentit does not know if there's any otherblock running in that queueand then the sync type it's not thebackground thread but main thread fadesfor it to finish so it blocks the ui wecannot the app is unresponsive for thatmoment of time yeah so it should be usedwith the appit's a little bit different rightyeahso that's why i said that it shouldalways be used with air i mean do wereally need to block the userinteraction of the app but that's not agood thing to do right you cannot 100contact with that yeah all right so onemore question about uh this topic souhwhat kind of issues could we havein our app if you have a memory leakuh like apple only allows alimited amount of memory to be used assoon as it reaches a limit the app'sgonna crashandthat's the worst that can happen i meanthat's a very bad thing so uhwe need to attack keep track of memorybecause it's always using a modernmemory and that means if the app iseating battery as wellokay well monitor is more resources niceall right so and what's the differencebetween arc and garbage collectionuh airc automatic left stress countingand relies on compile time referenceobject i meanwhen the code is compiling itthe code because the compilers guessesor make a listwhen an object is not referenced anymorethat it can be allocatedand it can be uhit is executed on the runtime so uhsorry real time uh not runtime and itdoes not need any background processingand but it has a disadvantage that itcannotkill or handle retain cycleswhere this is the corpus collection itrelies on runtime based reachableobjects andit is one timewhich will detect all the unused objectsgraph and eliminateretain cyclesand the advantages of it it can get itcan clean up the entire object includingretain cycle and as it's proceeding thebackground so like memory managementwork is required uh disadvantage of thatas it happens in background we don'thave the exact time frame of our objectreleased right andwhen the gc happens right other threadsin the applicationare temporarily put on holdokay all right and what do youunderstand about closures in swift forexampleyeah closures uhuh you shouldn't say thatyou have uh there's a function thatperforms some tasks and you it there isan async uh or the thing you know thathas that need to be paid right so youyou use closures and it has to typeescaping and non-escaping uh by defaultall with the non-escaping that meansthat the closure is executed within thesame function when before the functionis returned the closure will be executedand if uhthat is called escaping uh it can beexecuted any time and the function mayhave returned definitely have returnedand after that may be like we areloading data from api we call a functionthat just fetch me datafor that url and the function isreturned the data is done after 30seconds 20 seconds or whatever and itcan be executed so ifwe have that inforequirement where the data can take timeandwe have to move on another task so weuse escaping it's getting closernicethat was really great okay uh so my legmy last question for you is um how wouldyou keep yourself up to date with ios orwith this uh environmentuh the best thing and never miss a wwdcright i always have that on my calendareven or if you have missed it it'salways available on youtube but i willrecommend all the developers that arewatching the video wwdc is not a thingto miss it keeps you updated even if youare a senior developer and you knoweverythingthat i guess nobody doesyou have like we have to stay updatedand always try to teach your juniorsbecause sometimes juniors learn newthings that which seniors don't becausethey are more rigid uh connected withtheenvironment and i think they arelearning things so that like there areso many things that i have learned frommy juniors because they they have itbefore mei want to see some other tasksso that that was that was really niceokay also uh with this we come to theend of this meeting today okay uh i'mgonna pass you to the next step for sureokay you deserve to get the job with usbecause you are really really a greatdeveloper you give me excellent answersall right so with that said i'm gonnapass you to the next step okay youreally deserve to get a ios job with usuh and so by the way this is what i sayduring the interview okay you alreadyget the job with us so you are a reallyreally really great developer and thatwas so nice to speak with you today sothank you for that okay and to everybodyelse thank you forturning this mock into the video seriespossible and i hope you enjoy it as muchas i did and we will back very soon withmany other episodes till then give yougive us a big fat thumbs up commentsection below what moremocking tv would like to see here anddon't forget to subscribe to our channelokayuh if you are looking for jobs or for uhyou can just go ahead at turin.coms lessjobs search for the job that is relatedto your tech stack okay and apply forthose jobs so you get the job and thenyou you will work remotely 100 remote aswe didokay and with that that's that's allabout it so thanks for watching and ihope to see you again[Music]
