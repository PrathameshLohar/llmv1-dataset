hi everyone it's jay from interviewquery here and the data science youtubejchannel the youtube j channeltoday i wanted to talk about the appledata science interviewwhat to expect what kind of any quesinterview questions are going to beaskedand then how apple conducts theirinterview processso as with other big tech companies therole of data science at appleactually really depends on what kind ofteam you're assigned tothe actual title of data scientists atapple functionsthe closest to a full stack datascientist rolethan any other kind of role out therealsoeveryone please check out interviewquery it's a website that i madespecifically to preparedata scientists for their interviews youcan filtera bunch of data science interviewquestions by companyrun sql queries discuss solutions andlearn data science with our in-depthsolution guides that we provideyou can sign up at interviewquery.comand get a free weeklyinterview question in your inbox thismeans the job will requireprobably more of machine learningsoftware design to analytics to alsoplain engineeringit really does depend on what kind of arole you're looking for at apple and theteams are spread acrosseverything from itunes to siri to mapsetc mostly for the skill set howeverapple does only hirecandidates with at least probably two tothree years of experiencethey don't really hire any junior datascientistsor junior engineers for that matter andso mostlyif you have prior experience uh doingdata science another at another companythey're more likely to hire you onprobably in a fewexceptions are they probably going tobring you on as just afull-time junior data scientist rightout of school the apple data scientistrole is actuallyvery much dependent upon which team thatyouget assigned to and so the interviewprocess isn't actually strictlystreamlined like it is at other thingcompanies rightand so what you'll probably expect isyou'll seean interview that's kind of customizedand tailored depending on howthe data science hiring manager isthinking about itand how they actually want to plan outthe interview process this means thatthere could be anything fromcase questions to analytics toleak code questions to machine learningtheory it's all kind of under the sunand it really tailors to the positionitself and so it's really important tojust read the positionunderstand what you're going to be doingon a day to day and then try to extractthe skills that you need to prepare thenfor the interview depending on theactualuh data science role that you're goingfor there may or may not bea take-home challenge in the processinitially it always starts with you knowa phone screen with a recruiterthen usually there is a take-homechallenge given by the hiring manageruh if you are interviewing for a rolewith a hiring manager that does not havea take-home challenge and you'llprobably skip on to a technical screenwith another apple data scientistand then finally there's an on-siteround in which they talk throughuh you know you go through six differentkinds of data scientists productmanagersand then also a hiring manager and gothroughthe different kinds of skill tests thatyou have to passthe most common interview questions thatwe've seen on the apple data scientistinterview revolve around sqland python exercises as well as datascience reasoning questionsthese are then kind of more like casequestionsslash modeling case questions that goover basic fundamentals of machinelearninggenerally when you're faced withwhiteboard and coding interviews appleinterviewers seem to favorquestions around linked lists arraysstring and system designultimately for the more analytics rolesa lot of theapple interviewers do do a lot of sqland product basedcase questions and then ultimately atthe end of the day theywill always ask a b testing andexperiment design questionsbut because apple is more like ahardware or like a streaming companyor more so in like the generally sellingproductsthere's not too many experimental designscenariosas there would be when you're expectinga interview at facebook or googlewhere they have these large platforms uhwhereany single design can influence uh manydifferentkinds of behaviors lastly datascientists at apple can be very highlypaid depending on what level you fallintouh an example salary for an individualcontributor at level four could be150 to 180 k in base salary with a 10bonus and 200 to 300k in soccer for fouryearswhich leads to a total compensation ofaround you know 300 to 400 000 dollarsuh the refreshers for stock can also bevery high every single yearuh apple cares a lot about retaininglike good talentuh and they obviously probably rankevery single one based on yourperformanceuh and see how you do every single yearafter thathere are some apple data scienceinterview questions so describe thedifference betweenl1 and l2 regularization specifically inregards to the difference in theirimpact on the model training processwhat is

suppose you have around 100 000files spread across multiple servers andyou want to process all of themhow would you do that in hadoopultimately uhif you like a lot of these videos pleaselike and
