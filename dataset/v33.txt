hey everyone how's it going my name ismayuko and welcome back to my channelwhere we talk about techcareer and life first of all i've gotnew merch which i'm super excited aboutbecause it's been a while so make sureto check out the products in the merchshelf down belowor in the store link in the descriptionbox so as a lot of you know i worked asan ios developer in silicon valley forsix yearsand over the course of the last two tothree years of my channel i've talked alot about why ilove ios development and while i don'tnecessarily regret this career path thati took like it afforded me a lot ofgreat opportunities and i'm supergrateful for them and i do enjoy makingios apps i also think it's important totalk aboutthe cons because after like two or threeyears of like hyping up bios developmenti feel like it's time for me to liketalk about why i don't like it as wellbecause nothing is ever perfectyou know there's no perfect technologyor perfect careerso i just wanted to shed some light onthat side if you're watching this videothen maybe you're considering a careerin ios development or you're just kindof canvassingand seeing what's out there and you wantto learn the pros and cons of everythingunfortunately i personally can't give alot of pros and cons for all the otherfields because ios development is all iever know but i hope this helpsregardlessor maybe you're here just because you'recurious which is also super duperwelcomethanks for watching and i hope yousubscribe and before we dive in i wantedto say thank you to brilliant forsponsoring today's videoif you're

will get20off the annual premium subscription somake sure to check it out thank youagain to brilliant for sponsoring andlet's get back to the videoso the first point is that not everycompany needs an appif you think about all the platforms andservices and websites out therea lot of them need like a website butnot every single one of them need an iosandandroid app and so as a result choosingios development as a career path meantthat kind of mychoices were limited in where i couldwork granted in 2020 and the 2010s mostpeoplewanted to make an app for their productanyways and so it wasn't so limiting butif you look at the number of jobs in webdevelopment for examplecompared to ios development the sizesare completely differentat the same time some products arebetter suited for ios apps versuswebsites as well soit kind of goes both ways but i do thinkthat it's more universal forcompanies to want websites before makingan appnext is that not every company needs alot of ios developerskind of relating to the previous pointeven if a company has an ios appthey don't necessarily want to alwaysinvest a lot in mobileand that's because the use case doesn'tmake sense or they haven'tfound one that does i started iosdevelopment in 2014and throughout the whole six years it'salso just been a struggle to convincecompanies to just likeinvest in higher ios developers toothere's always this debateof like mobile first web first likewhich one goes first if you had toprioritize somethingand oftentimes mobile loses out sohonestly i've spent a fair amount oftime convincing leaders product leadersthat mobile is worth investing in eventhough i'm an engineerbut how else am i going to have thingsto work on ifi don't convince people that it's animportant thing to work on it'sdefinitely getting better over timethoughmore and more companies are like yeah noduh we need an app for thisor you know they go mobile first evenjust from the get-go butit's something to keep in mind i thinknext on the list for why i don't likeios development and which is actuallyprobably like my biggestcon is that it's really expensive to bean ios developer for those of you whodon't knowyou have to develop ios apps and macapps ona mac like you can't do it on linux orwindows or anythingwhich then means that in order to createios apps you have to have a macbookand there's a lot of mac products outthere with varying price points buti do feel like you need at least amacbook pro you can run xcode on any macbut if you run it on something like amacbook airit's just gonna be really smoothi think like a 13-inch macbook pro haslike the minimum specsof processing power in order to runeverything i mean also like xcode takeslike almost 20 gigs of space on yourcomputer so it's just likeit just rules out a lot of people ifmacs are that expensive and that'swhat you need as an entry into thisfield so yeah the financial burden isreal so it literally rules out so manypeople from becoming ios developers tobegin with becausenot everyone can afford a mac this isexactly why things like web developmentcatch on much faster becauseanybody with any machine from anywhereno matter their financial situation canstart codingand apple consciously chooses theirprice points like this and so until theyintroduce like a two to three hundreddollar or even five hundred dollar maclineyeah it's just gonna be extremelyexclusive so yeah that's something thati reallydon't like about ios development thenext thing is that xcodeis kind of hard to work with xcode forthose of you who don't know is theofficial idefor ios development made by apple and soit's great because it's integratedat every level like apple makes aprogramming language the machines thephones the idethe frameworks and everything but it'sjust it just doesn't work for mesometimesthere's actually a lot of jokes in theios development community about likehow to coax xcode to do what you want itto andcompared to some of the third-partytools out there it is still the best butit doesn't make it any easier to workwith sometimes because ios developmentnecessitates a compilation processcompile times can be super duper longdepending on the machine that you haveand it also gives like really crypticlike hard to understand error messagessometimesand you often just have to clear thecache and you have to like restart yourcomputer and whatnot so it's just likeit's just a part of ios development andi wish it workeda little bit easier but no developmenttool is perfect so i guess that's justwhat we got nonetheless it still made mylist for why i don't like iosdevelopment soios development is kind of a nichetechnology so i think it's actuallyharder to translate to othertechnologies that are out therelike my impression of web developers andother developers that it's really easyor fairly easy for them to pick up otherkinds of technologies and programminglanguagesbut because ios development is a closedecosystem and things do change but notsuper drasticallyit's just harder to like do like acareer change and hop acrossto become a front-end developer forinstance so if you choose your vote asan ios developer you can't kind of likechoose and hop between different thingsbut i mean ios is still niche though andi say this because the patterns used inios and swiftare historically very but yeah it justbecomes harder and harder if you like topick up other thingsbut yeah it's still i mean it's juststill niche next on the list which is iknow a really big pain thatall ios developers share is that youcan't deploythings whenever you want unlike webdevelopment where you can deploy likethousands of things a day and you candeploy whenever you want at any hour ofthe daythat's not the case for ios developmentand that's because we have somethingcalled an app store review processapple put this in to ensure a level ofquality and safetyfor all the apps that they have on theapp store for its userswhich is great you know i think that's agood thing it means that you can'tlike download a virus if you download anapp from the app store but fordevelopers it means that you have to gothrough a review process with appleevery single time you want to make anupdate to your appa really brief overview is that yousubmit a binary to applethey review it in about a day or two andthen they mayaccept or reject it and then if it'saccepted that you can publish it but ifit's rejected you have to do a lot ofback and forth and try to fix the issueand you have to adhere to all the appstore review guidelinesso yeah the fact that you have to likewait a day for apple to get to your appalone justmakes that whole process a lot longerand so you have to kind of plan yourreleasesand it also means that if you put out aproduction bug out there then oh boyit's going to be out there foryou know at least half a day so yeah youjust have to be more carefuland lastly on the list and i don'treally know how to like convey this buti thoughti should say it is that like iosdevelopment is like a little bitcampy which maybe all development iskind of like this but i feel like iosdevelopment in particularis and i mean i think it's because it'slike apple you know a lot of peoplerevereapple and sometimes in the iosdevelopment community it's like theyrevere apple so much that it feels likea religionor a cult and it's just like it's justkind of weird it's like apple is thisgod that changes and releases updatesand stuff and you're always just like ohmy god apple that's so amazing it's sogreator you always criticize it for what itdidn't do and it's just like chillyo it's just a company and some productsthere's stuff like rivalry with androidand i'm just like dude likewho cares like everyone will usewhatever the phone they want and yesmaybe it matters in the business worldbut likeno point in ios developers getting allup in arms about who's better and who'sworse it's likeeverything exists for a reason andthere's no better or worse so just likeleave it it's like not a big deal okayso yeah because of this kind of likeculture of wireless developmentand the financial hurdle that you haveto overcomein order to be one it's not always themost welcoming placei mean there are a ton of greatresources ios developers ios tutorialsand teachers and websites and resourcesthat are super welcoming i can name afew and i will leave them in thedescription box down belowbut yeah some pockets of it are justlikesort of weird and i'm like why why yougotta be like thatbut yeah that could probably be said forlike all development and technologiesout there it's justi mean it's a thing in the applecommunity as well so yeah that's it ihope you enjoyed this video and you gotto hear a little bit aboutmy personal opinion views early mine ofwhy i don't like ios development do istill like it yes well i still keepdoing itof course but yeah like i said i want tomake sure that you all get the fullpicture that it's not this glimmeringperfect technology out thereand maybe you already knew that but justwanted to talk from my own experience asi doon the rest of this channel so yeah makesure to give this
