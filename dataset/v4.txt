[MUSIC PLAYING]SPEAKER: What is Apple best known for?Easy answer, for its innovation in hardware, software,and services for a wide range of products, such as computers,iPhones, and iPads.Now here's what's less known and equallysignificant about the company, its organizational designand the associated leadership model thathave played a crucial role in driving its innovation success.It all began after Steve Jobs returned to Appleas CEO in 1997.One of his first acts on his return,laying off the general managers of all the business unitsin a single day, not a move that inspires a welcome party.But there was a method to Jobs' madness.Apple at the time had a conventional structurefor a company of its size and scope.It was divided into business units,each with its own profit and loss responsibilities.Jobs believed this conventional management stifled innovation.He put the entire company under one P&Land combined the different functional departmentsof the business units into one functional organization.Simply put, a functional structuredivides an organization into departmentsbased on their function.These departments are headed by functional managerswho are experts in the roles they supervise.The functional structure, which Apple retains to this day,ensures that those with the most expertise and experiencein a particular domain have the decisionrights for that domain.Senior vice presidents at Apple then,are in charge of functions, not products.As was the case with Jobs before him,current CEO Tim Cook occupies the only positionon the organizational chart where the design, engineering,operations, marketing, and retail of anyof Apple's main products meet.In effect, besides the CEO, the companyoperates with no conventional general managers.Apple's structure is based on two views.First, the organization competes in a marketwith a high rate of technological changeand disruption.It has to rely on the judgment and intuitionof technical experts who can predictwhich technologies and designs are likely to succeed.General managers are unlikely to be able to do that.Second, Apple's commitment to offer the bestpossible products would not be achieved if cost and pricetargets were the fixed parameters within which to makedesign and engineering choices.Instead, R&D leaders are expectedto weigh the benefits to users against cost considerations.A case in point is the decision to introduce the dual lenscamera with Portrait Mode in the iPhone 7 Plus in 2016.Paul Hubel, a senior leader who played a central rolein the Portrait Mode effort and his teamwere taking a big risk, if users wereunwilling to pay a premium for a phone with a morecostly and better camera, the teamwould have less credibility the next timeit proposed an expensive upgrade or feature.The camera turned out to be a defining feature for the iPhone7 Plus.Under a traditional structure, Hubel would nothave been empowered to take such a riskand the feature would likely not havebeen made because traditional cost and price analysislack a deep understanding of users' needs.It's easier to get the balance right between attentionto costs and the value added to the user experiencewhen the leaders making decisionsare those with deep expertise in their areas.This explains Jobs' decision to change the way Apple works,the combination of its organizational structureand its leadership model not only saved the companyfrom bankruptcy but also transformed itinto one of the most influential tech companies in the world.
