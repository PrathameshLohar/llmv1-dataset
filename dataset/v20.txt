in today's video I'm going to talk aboutsome of the most asked questions atApple during their job interviews andbasically I've done it I compiled thelist with a 36 most commonly askedquestions which are better group intointo nine categories that I'm going totalk about today and just quickly beforewe begin 15% of any question asked in anApple interview including the technicalones contains the word customer so ifthere's one takeaway this this would befor the whole thing also that there arethere are almost a hundred occurrencesof the key word strength here whichwould be of course an indicator of thefact that you should actually focus onyour strengths in in a job interview sowithout further ado let's let's see whatwe have here and the the first group ofquestions that I would like to talkabout is the ones linked withdecision-making so questions relate thedecision-making might be tell me aboutthe toughest decision you had to make inthe past six months or tell me about thetime you had to deal with ambiguity or atime when you faced a problem that hadmultiple solutions or described adifficult decision you've had to make inyour business life and how you wentabout doing it or simply tell me aboutthe time when you took the lead on adifficult project you see it so itdoesn't mean that if I put thesequestions in a decision-making contextthat this is a strict science forexample the last question about them youtook a little difficult project couldalso be talking easily be about yourinterpersonal skills but I put them herebecause I found this would be the morerelevant context in in our case by theway you know it no need to write downthis this information I included thesethese questions in the video descriptionso maybe also interesting to talk abouthere is you whatwell what's a good answer and what's abad answer when it comes to decisionmaking in general maybe maybe if we takethe first example tell me about thetoughest decision decision we have tomake in the past six months would be amore concise way to talk about thisthing so a good answer would be ananswer where you give a genuine exampleof something you really done in the pastsix months within ideally innum it in ateam context if possible because you seethese corporations are teams of peopleso whenever you give an example youshould consider taking one out of a teamexperience also you know you should bevery much aware that no matter how smartyou are some of the toughest decisionsare a team effort so asking for help isactually something that would score yourpoints if you choose to mention it whileanswering such questions basically butwhat's the second question the secondexample how do you deal with ambiguityis also a very relevant way a veryrelevant approach to measure theeffectiveness of an answer when it comesto decision-making so are you good atdealing with ambiguity howdywhat are the steps you took to deal toaddress that specific situation so ofcourse you know unless you unless youlive under under rock you'd know aboutthe star method to answer these types ofbehavior questions so while answeringthe questions rate decision making thebulk of the the most important part ofthe star answer is actually the actionpart of it and of course you know frombecoming from taking this answer fromgood that is a great decision-makingprocess to a great answer you would alsohave to quantify know to provide somequantifiable results that resulted fromfrom your actionso this is how you would answerquestions related with decision-makingalso maybe one last note here recentexamples are always preferred andactually this is this actually becomesobvious from the first question in thepast six months so always keep in mindthat recent examples are betters theeighth category here is about curiosityso actually everyone starts somewheretell me about the time when you were newon the joband had a lot to learn how did youmanage that so when talking aboutcuriosity they are interested in yourability to learn I was someone that's aquick learner because you see we it'simpossible whenever you get into a newrole especially at one of the companiessuch as Apple to to be able to to knoweverything in advance so in order tosucceed in such an environment you mustbe a quick learner and someone soundsgenuine genuinely curious by definitionhow do you do how do you show thesethings well you could actually basicallyuse the keyword curiosity I'm a curiousperson I'm a quick learner and all thesethings in Europe in your answer butfurther than this you should have acertified that you you see this as ajourney instead of a destination so youadd the type of person who is connectedto the news who regularly follows thenews for foreign you events and for thelatest technologies and so on and soforth basically this is not that it'sone of the easier questions rightbecause why would you apply it for jobat such innovative company unless youyou are genuinely interested in thesethings the seventh category of questionshere are related with success basicallythese are gifts that the intervieweroffer you to basically showcase focus onyour strengths and there are fourexamples so tell meabout the team project you worked onremember the word key or the key wordteam tell me about the time you exceededyour expectations give me an example ofa time when you when you set a goal andwere able to meet or achieve it anddescribe a long-term project that youmanaged how did you keep everythingmoving along in a timely manner so againthese are giftswhenever you're being offered such aquestion that's your that's your abilityto shine that's when you have you thisunique opportunity and what better wayto capitalize on it it's done to prepareit in advance of course how would youprepare the most successful project youhave now well that's pretty much up toyou but I what I can tell you and frommy coaching business it's that I usuallyrecommend it to prepare these mainhighlights of your career whilepreparing and also for tell me aboutyourself when answering tell me whatyou're so basically you should give aquick overview over what you've donewith some of the main highlights in yourcareer two of them one two maybe eventhree if you have a lot of experience sothis is how you would go on success andof course needless to say but focus onyour on your strengths the sixthcategory of questions that are askedquite a lot in in Apple interviews arerelated with deadlines in general doneabout the time when you were not able tomeet a time commitment what preventedyou from meeting it what was the outcomeand what did you learn from it oranother variation of it do you feel likeyou work well on the pressure if sodescribe a time when did when you'vedone so actually when you delivered onhonor under pressure and these questionsabout meeting deadlines are of courseyou know and on one hand the interviewerwants to see so let's take the firstquestion when you were not able to meetthe time commitment this is a failurestory actually right the first thingsomeone would be interestedwell when asking you this question iswhether you have a genuine failure andbelieve it or not most people don't havejourney and failures or have failuresthat the sugar-coated are failures thatare not quantifiable or are not realfailures or they give a generalhypothetical story just because theydon't like failure which is you know anatural sentiment so this is the firstthing why number one mistake that peoplemake when when talking about failurestories now what's a great answer here agreat answer would be one that talks oneor two senses about the situation two ortwo sentences about that specific damhow you fail to achieve the deadline andthree sentences on the learnings fromthis so the book of your answer shouldbe focused on your learnings andactually you know that the question isphrased in such a way what was theoutcome and what did you learn from itso it's self-explanatory but more oftenthan I do you won't we won't get thislucky into a job interview they won'tread the full thing the second one doyou feel you work well under pressureso you you must think of a situationwhere you delivered under pressure andagain it must be a star answer so uhideally it should be a team example ofall time you worked in a team again asalways and I believe you you also havean opportunity here to score some pointson interpersonal skills if you forexample you use your communication yourcommunication ability to to prevent anydelays in a project and to use this toyour advantage maybe you know a memberof your team got sick and you had tohire someone else and you've done soquickly so again you will be to hirepeople so these are all there can be allkind of scenarios were delivering siteis something on a tight deadline was waspretty difficult and basically I woulddefinitely recommend you to prepare thisin advance it must be really somethingspecial that would highlight on yourability to deliver under pressure andbasically you should find an examplethat that highlights on on the pressurepart of of this whole thing all rightnumber five is actually you know apretty common question asking during jobinterviews what your strengths andwhat's your weakness needless to say inthe beginning of the video I said thatthe word strength is appears quite oftenaround 100 times in questions and in inthe according to my research there butand this is because what happens oftenis that people tend to believeespecially outside the US that tend tobelieve that talking about yourstrengths is self advertising yourselfand it will be set here in some cultureit does sound like this but even so I dobelieve that it's a great strategy to tothink about what are your one two threemain strengths and not only that but tofocus on some stories that wouldhighlight these strengths ordifferentiators in other words in ifyour strengths is for example you willbe to deliver under tight deadlines thenyou should think of a time where it wasimpossible to deliver on tight undertight deadlines but you did it anywaythis is how you should look at thesethingsnow the weakness part is probably theless intuitive of these and when the forthe weakness many people feel like theydon't they don't have a proper weaknessand they actually turn a positive into anegative day they say for example thatmy main weakness is paying too muchattention to details which is actuallyis trying to no because why on earthwould you apply for companies such asApple when you don't have it when youhave attention to detail I mean it makesno sense you cannot have attention todetail you have too much attentionattention to detail it did it's you knowor another one that I find suspicious isI have a very bad work-life balance Ithink you see it it could be a weaknessI'm not saying it's notbut when applying it such a company youare competing against 100 other peoplejust 50 all rightthe interview job is between others tosee hey is this person someone for whomI enjoy working with or if you say it ifyou say it if you put in such a way thatI'm a workaholic I am I'd never leavethe office I'm not sure this is the typeof people most people would want to workwith or let me put it another way ifthis candidate has no personal life isthis type of content a candidate whom Iwant to share my office with and youknow inherently or my experience or mygood part of my life actually I wouldsay I would very much argue that mostpeople do not think this way you seethere are people who would there arewho'd that for sure but I don't believemost people would especially employeesbecause you see you go out work andbasically you are supposed to have a lotof fun at work right or if people haveif for someone who has seriouschallenges with your breath balance Idon't think that person is too much funso this is my take but anyhow try tofind a proper weakness here I've doneother videos about weaknesses withexamples and all that stuff if you wantto reference them but trying to findproper witnesses and try to findsituations where exhibited that weaknessand how you grow from that from thatweakness and make sure it's still aweakness for example if you would callintroversion as a weakness that issomething that you cannot fix entirelyright you're still an introvert bydefinition but still you can improve itso yeah this will be the main things andthe only reason why is spending so muchon this because I know many peoplestruggle with this thing so I woulddefinitely encourage you to realize thatit's actually an important point thatyou should focus on and not not only forthe sake of answering questionbut for the sake of building up anefficient strategy for the overallinterview and have the proper tacticwhile while answering questions numberfour the number four most asked group ofquestions during job interviews at Appleare about dealing with conflict failurein difficulties and we already touchedupon a time when you failed on adeadline but here are some other ones sogive me an example of a time you faced aconflict while working on a team how didyou handle thattell me about the time when you receivednegative feedback from your manager howdid you respond to mobile done you hadthe conflict that worked I know aboutthe situation where you had to solve adifficult problem tell me about time yourecovered from a difficult situationtell me what done when you failed themwhat you learned from it the last timeyou had to apologize to someone and tellme about the time when you missed anobvious solution to a problem so you seethese are I actually I actually would godifferently and answering themtell me what time when you failed andwhat you learned from it from yourecover from a difficult situationbecause the first one is a negativestory the second one doesn't have to soI'd rather make it a positive one butstill there's a conflict there's adifficulty and there's a failure intothese examples and there is no I groupedthem together is because I've I stronglybelieve that these types of of events inyour career I easy to spot if we groupthese with both failures with both whenyou resolve the difficult to solve whenyou successfully solved a difficultproblem these could be quite relatedbecause more often than other whathappens here is once you zoom out ofzooming of a situation the story becomeseither failure or success this isactually what's life all about it atleast in my opinionso these group of questions areinevitably going to be asked to getasked in any job interview so you'dbetter think about situationschallenging situations where you'reeither delivered either failed todeliveras when it comes to when it when itcomes to questions such as you receivenegative feedback from your manager theidea is that you want to build trustthere so in other words you don't wantto make of course you don't want yourmanager to look like like someone badbecause this would mean putting theblame on someone else which would be adisqualifier for any candidate in anyjob interview at most high-performingcompanies but furthermore the differencebetween good and great examples ismatter is whether you manage to buildtrust with that person so this is thisis how you should go about receivingnegative feedback from your manager aswhen it comes to conflict on your teamthat's an obvious pitch to yourinterpersonal skills that is how well docommunicate how well how on whetheryou're someone who considered thatwriting an email would be enough whichwould be a terrible idea why becauseit's a cold communication method and youknow the way it resolved these things isthat you call on a meeting or you knowtalk about it face to face takeownership of that specific situation andyeah these would be the main thing ohthe last time you had to apologizesomeone here people tend to tend to sayhey I have many times I apologize tosomeone but they they have troublescoming up with with a good example onthe spot so I draw the prepare for itagain all these are in the videodescription so you can easily referencethem if you if you want so the thirdmost asked group of questions at Appleare direct pitches to interpersonalskills so I have again eight exampleshere an example when you saw peerstruggling in sidestepping and help howyou go about answering such a questionwell you must take ownership over thesituation you must show your coachingskills and your listening skills so thiswould begreat in broader details what did you dowhen you need to motivate a group ofindividuals again it goes on the samelines an example when you have to pushback to HQ challenge the decision yesit's maybe not the same but I've touchedupon this previously describe a timewhen you were faced with a stressfulsituation and used your coping skillsagain your bid deliver on the pressurebut more like and more like you know ina team context think about it's not justwhen you've done a solo project all byourselves think about in the teamcontext and this is why I put thisprobably this actually in theinterpersonal skills let's say you needsomething important from a co-worker andthe person is just responding how willyou deal with this an interesting one aswell we've all had to work with peoplethat don't like us how do you deal withsomeone that does not like you try tofind a proper example here because it'simpossible not to have have hadoccurrences of such situation thoughunless maybe your recent graduate whereyou could probably take an example fromfrom from a university project or schoolproject but still it's impossible not tohave this and how you deal with suchsituations well first you listen so keepin mind to listen use your listeningskills tell me about them when you workwith a difficult team member again youlisten you communicate you ask forothers people advice and so on describea time when you found it difficult towork with someone from a differentbackground again on same lines and thesecond most asked actually the firstmost asked group of questions in Appleinterviews is questions unsurprisinglyrelated with customers to customer focustell me about the time an image or acustomer was pleased with your servicewe all deal with difficult customersfrom time to time tell me about thechallenging client situation now itDelta Henry handled it this with thefirst two needless to say the customeris the center of everythingdo we always start with the customer andwork backwards to quote from fromanother company's leadership principlesso here you know of course it's alwaysabout the customer and if these group ofquestions is the most commonly asked ina interviews I would assume it's a goodenough reason to prepare these things inadvance and by the way you should alsoyou should also keep in mind that Applehas seven new leadership principlesunder keep team cook it's great productsimple not complex and ecosystemcollaboration sayno excellence andaccept mistakes I have another video onthat one if you if you want to look atto get a feel of of the behaviorsinvolved in there and I believe thiswould this could definitely help you tocraft better answers for your for yourquestions yes some other examples ofquestions tell me what the longest timeit took you to conclude a deal with acustomer or how do you show yourcustomer obsession or tell me about timewhen you went above and beyond in acustomer centric way and finally tell meabout the last time a customer got upsetwith you you see maybe yeah so one notehere that I don't see many people doit's actually when you talk aboutstories with customers to always not donot forget to be in your company's bestinterest in other words if if if thecustomer came came to you with a brokeniPad you do not just say oh I need toreplace the iPad despite the fact isgonna is not financially financiallyviable for the company it's you see youmust put it in a context that makessense you must follow some proceduresyou must eventually assess the situationso on so forth so it must make senseeverything with this customer focus mustmake sense in the end of course you wantto fix the customers problem and in factmy experience with Apple products hasbeenwith Apple customer support it's notthat they are the most likeable peopleon earth but when compared to somehowApple's competitors they are the mostefficient so when they have to solve aproblems they fix it other companiesmight be oh yes we're very nice was soon we understand and we listen to and soon so and they never fix it so this hasbeen my experience with Apple productsand I'm saying again so Apple Applecustomer super representatives havealways been effectivenot necessarily nice people buteffective so there are business peopleso keep in mind that when you're goingin the job interview you must save showthat you you have that understanding onhow business or how did the businessthat you're getting into words and whenI'm saying the business that you I'm nottalking about the overall Apple I'mtalking about your job in particularthis is very very very important andlast but not least the most commonlyasked questions at at Apple during anyjob interview is why Apple andsurprisingly and there are many ways youcould answer why Apple and from fromfrom my experience what most people willdo will to praise that Applecontinuously to never stop talking abouthow great of a company Apple really isand about the product and the problemwith this approach is this is thateveryone does this so your goal in a minapplication process to differentiateyourself from other candidates sowhat ways do you have to differentiateyourself from other from othercandidates well one of them would be totalk how can you make a difference atApple and as all it might seem becauseyou know Apple is a big company so on soforth they actually dot the disk wherethis question this challenge actuallymakes sense in a context of answeringwhy Apple and furthermoreit's watching for you from thisexperience again my earlier referencethis is a bit this is business where doyou see yourself in next five years herewhat they have to benefit from from thisexperience these are all things that youcould talk about while answering whyApple and I believe that more often thannot they will appreciate these thingsand of course that they will alwaysappreciate if you prepare this inadvance because it will sound so muchbetter so these would be some high leveladvice from from eBay store according tosome research that I done not not toolong ago and so these would be thequestions that are most commonly askedabout definitely in ecology to take alook of it and prepared them in advancemaybe I would also want to emphasizethat preparing for this question shouldmeet us the only thing you should dowhat preparing for for the interview butit's this should hopefully give you anaccelerator and the way to do you knowto basically achieve a lot more thanthen it would have been otherwisepossible by just simply indexing as manybehavioral questions and so on so forthso these are you know the questions Ifind I am pretty confident of thesethings being able to again to accelerateto speed up your preparation process asalways I hope you found this informationuseful and thank you very much forwatching
