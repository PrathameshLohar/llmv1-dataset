in the last quarter of 2021apple made a profit of 20.6billion dollars in one quarter so youwould definitely assume that theirsoftware engineers are top paid andthere is no other company that can payas much as apple does hi friends welcomeback to my channel where i talk aboutsoftware engineering and financialindependence while living an intentionallife in this video we are talking abouthow much money apple software engineersmake i'll be breaking down theirsalaries level by level and also breakdown how that package works stick aroundtill the end to find out if apple is aremote friendly company and if there areany other companies that are paying morethan apple ic2s are junior engineersthat are making167 000 us dollars every year at applethis pay package is actually broken downinto base stock and bonus on topso their base is 126 000with a stock payout of 26 000and a bonus of 15 000the way that the stock payout works isit usually starts resting after thefirst year is completed by the employeein the company that kind of keeps themmotivated to bevery high performing in their first yearimpress all their peers and managers andbosses and whatnot so after one year isspent in the company 25 of their entirestock package is vested after thatusually it's a cadence of a quarterlyinvesting but some companies also restevery month and by investing i mean that25of the entire stock package is nowusable you can either execute it you cansell it or you can just keep it for itto grow and then use it up later infuture the next level of softwareengineering is the ic3 this title isplain software engineer to help youunderstand what an ic2 a junior levelengineer or a software engineer and whatthe distinction is let me compare andcontrast these two engineersan entry-level software engineer isfresh out of college so all they arelaced with is information that theystudied in the courses so they must havestudied algorithms data structures maybesome web technologies i did roboticsartificial intelligence and a whole lotof software engineering stuff but nowi'm going to this real world job and ihave to do a smart job of asking enoughquestions to more experienced peers andcolleagues in order to make sense of allof these pieces and build software alongwith them so usuallyat this stage you are in a very rapidgrowth phase you are listening verycarefully in your meetings most of yourpeers will be giving you a little bit ofdirect direction and feedback and yourmanagers will be kind of hand holdingyou to let you understand how the entireteam works but as you become a softwareengineer and i see freeat this time you are expected to knowthe ins and outs of your teams and whatare the roles that are played byeverybody at this time you still may notbe able to run an entire project alonebut you will be part of a small teamusually two to three people and you'llbe writing methods and functions insideone project while getting a goodunderstanding of that project usually anew college grad can become an ic3 in atime frame of anywhere from six monthsto up to two years speaking of ic3engineers let's get into how much moneythey're making ic3s at apple in the year2022 can expect to make about 221 000 usdollars every single yearthat consists of a base salary of 148000 a stock component of 56 000and a bonus ofthousand dollars next comes the ic4 orthe senior software engineer thiscoveted role can be played by people whounderstand most of the pieces of thistechnology that the company is workingon and can confidently take up a projectand execute it all by themselves theyare great team players they are goodmentors and they understandall of the team members functions andhow to ask the right questionsusually somebody can become a seniorsoftware engineer as early as two and ahalf years into their careers to up toaround the fourth or fifth year markalmost everyone is moving from thatsoftware engineer to the senior softwareengineer role at apple a senior softwareengineer can expect to make around336 000thanks to the higher base pay of 191 000per yeara stock component of 121 000and a bonus of 24 thousand dollars thenext level now is that of the ic5 ithink of the ic5s as a kind oftransition between a senior softwareengineer and an architect level rolethey are now getting very well versedwith all the technologies they areprobably in their seventh or eighth yearof their career and they are taking partin making major decisions as far astechnology choices and other bigprojects are concerned ic5s and ic6 arevery active in discussing how multiplepartner teams work together and howtheir relationships can be built ic5 iswhere a person can usually take thepivot from being a software engineer tobecoming an engineering manager as wellso at apple ic5s are making around 490000now the base salary has jumped up to 227000 per year with a stock component of222 000and an extra bonus of 41 000next the ic6the ic6 level is very close to that of aprincipal or staff software engineermoving towards the role of an architectat this level these people aredefinitely spending a lot of their timecoding but also creating a long-termvision and making sure that thetechnical health of the team is beingtaken care of a good ic607 is also agood leader they are mentoring juniorengineers and making sure that theengineering side of the things isworking well smoothly and very healthyan ic6 engineer commands a massivesalary of 760 000at apple neural surgeons can make thatmuch money as well this salary comprisesof a base package of 270 000with a stock component of 435000 and an added bonus of 65 000i hope these numbers are inspiring andgetting you fired up if you've beenthinking of becoming a software engineerand maybe you have that fire and energyto reach at this level in the next 10years you might be commanding 750 000 ormore in your yearly paychecks and thiscompany growing so hard and so fastevery single year this stock actuallyjust sits and grows so in the end theseengineers are really making more than amillion dollars every single year alongwith the hefty pay package appleengineers also enjoy the regularbenefits like health insurance dentalcoverage vision coverage and free foodoh no apple doesn't do thatsome of my friends work at apple andlet's just say they have some beef withthe generosity that apple has with theiremployees i don't think they have freefood one of my friends joked about howthe only free thing that they get at thecampus isapplesthe employees get maternity leave ofaround 16 weeks for mothers andfraternity leave for of six weeks forfathers i think apple you can do a lotbetter than that becausesix weeks is nothing and fathers alsoneed a lot of morning time with the babytheir paid time off is not the best manymany companies are doing unlimited paidtime mobs but that's kind of adouble-edged sword let me know if youguys want to see a separate video aboutthe whole unlimited paid time off thatthe silicon valley does there are a lotof pros but you might not imagine thatthere are many many cons of doing thatas well soif you want to see that video leave acomment down below and don't forget tosubscribe to my channel also like thisvideo if you've been enjoying learningabout how much money apple employees aremaking now let's talk about whetherapple provides remote job opportunitiesa year and a half ago i did speak to anapple recruiter personally just tryingto understand how the company isfunctioning and what kind of roles wereavailable i have been on a sabbaticalfrom a silicon valley job for almost twoand a half years but from time to time italked to recruiters just to see the layof the land and um i mentioned that ilive in hawaii and the recruiter was ithink pretty jealousbut jokes apart um they did mention thatif i wanted a job at apple and wanted tokeep it long-term that i would have tomove to cupertinoand that was a no for me becauseliving my best life here in hawaii um sothey aren't the most remote friendlycompany but recently tim cook announcedthat they are going to keep the remotework on indefinitely because of the newvariants of the disease overall thefeeling i got was that the companyreally wants their employees to comebackbut they're only allowing remote workfor the time being and to answer a majorquestion is apple the top top payer inthe silicon valley the answer is nothere are many other companies that arepaying more than apple does even thoughthey make way more profits than theseother companies for example netflixstrives really hard to pay its employeesa hundred percentilewhich means that they look at yourskills and the market demand of yourcertain position as a software engineerand they'll compare with any data thatthey have what other companies arepaying other software engineers at thesame level at the same demand as you andthey will beat whatever other companiesare paying to keep you at 100 percentileif that makes sense apple certainly isnot doing that they know that theirstock grows so much and historically uhemployees have seen that so they areokay with a little bit less pay for apotential future growth of the stockbecause also in comparison netflixdoesn't dostock payouts they have a high basesalary and it's all cash so let me knowwhat did you think about these applesalaries and would you like me to makemore videos about other companies wasthis video inspiring especially if youare a budding software developer if youare just starting school would you liketo work at a company like apple whywould you want to do that is it for thepay or for the passion of their productlet me know all of that in the commentsbelow and if you like this video youwill definitely like the video that imade about the pros and cons of being asoftware engineer thank you for watchingtill the end and i hope you're doingwell stay happy and healthy and i'll seeyou in the next one bye
