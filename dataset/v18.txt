Coming up next...Hi guys I am Nishant Chahar,So today we are gonna not talk about a person who has cracked three offersGoldman Sachs,Apple,and finally microsoft,and he is currently working at Microsoft                   But finding Apples exp online is a bit difficult thereforeI thought lets talk about ques,interview,main topics to focusSo watch the video till end, and before moving on click on that like button and do subscribe and commentlets take a little intro from himHello everyone I am currently graduating in CSE from IIT-BHU,I graduated in may 2021 in the pandemicSo I have been missing college life from last 1.5 years,BUT it has been an amazing journey thereI recently joined Microsoft just last week and the orientation has begun and it has been a fun process so farAnd I am looking forward doing great work at microsoft,In my placement MicrosoftApple and goldmansachs offered me So ofcourse I could choose one company so Microsoft had always inspired me how a company can changeits cause,So ya I'm looking to change my cause with it as wellSo We would talk about apples exp. as apples exp. is hard to find onlineSo Ritvik what was the process of Apple,rounds,online-tests tell us something about themSo Apple comes in very less colleges in our college also it came after 1yr so its rare to find itLuckily in 2019 they came so I had some seniors who were placed thereAnd they gave me some advice but this time the process was a bit differentTheres a type of thinking in all of us to do C.P for Bigtech,But I think you should know CS topics They ask little bit SQL so its a mixture of those thingsSo process of Apple in  IIT_BHU was they took a test in november and30-40 guys were shortlisted,but they further shortlisted only 15-20guysI think they removed non-circuital guys from the list,It was unfair as it was open for allSo then 1st round was simple test of around 120mins,3-4mcqs were based on CS fundamentalsLike Os or oops,ques were not too complexAnd 2ques were of dsa and it was easy for C.P guys,means it was easy for guys who prepared for SDE rolesLast ques was about sql in which we were needing to join two tables and give the resultsSo that was all about testAnd bro how many rounds were there and also were they based on dsa or cs fundamental,HRSo there were 3rounds 1st two were technical rounds and 3rd was an HR roundHR round was only for selected guys,it was more to see if the employee fits into the culture of apple rather than as an elimination round,but first 2rounds were technical but not too technicalmeans they maybe looked at the code quality and they evaluated a lot from the testSo they asked two dsa question 1 in each round but in the 2nd part of interview they talked about same dsaThat, why you didnt tried this and all so they shared a website in which they were also able to see what I codeSo they were constantly watching me when I was coding and they were telling to change variable,functions nameBut the ques were not difficult,I think they judge you on human readable code qualitySo my two rounds were of 1hr each,so in 1st round dsa was going on and then they looked at my resumeAnd one of my project was liked by interviewer a lot,so they discussed that we are solving same problem in our teamSo lot of people talk about luck in interview so this is one of the lucky momentthat your project is like attracting interviewer ,and they say lets talk about itSo we had a great talk and then when I had 2nd round my first rounds interviewertold 2nd rounds interviewer that this guy has done this this workAnd this is his project so the second guy also got interested and we talked about it againwe talked about 40-45mins,they asked ques about it like you have highend in US and datacenter in EuropeWill you use data sharding or cache or in memory.so they were asking high level design ques. Well I didnt expected it as I asked seniors and other people but things were not like thatBut maybe in 1st round they saw project and thought that this guy knows about Highlevel designSo lets talk about it with him,I dont know generally how apple takes interview but this is how it wentThey asked about HLD and not General HLD but they asked HLD based on my projectLike Scalability and about cloudservices and then they asked dsa which was simpleSo they asked dsa in 1st round and then they saw code readability and projectsSo I am giving a little example that you want to check whether a no. is odd or even,then if num%2==0 then evenBut some people who code fast use and1 to check odd,even,So this might work in a high pressure situation to solve a quesBut I think Apple judges you on variable names and code understandingsSo that kind of quality atleast in an interview is required when you're showing it to themYes,you can use tips and tricks to solve quickly,but in interview your code should be self-explanatoryYes,means in every interview same thing happens,they should understand our code easilyThere should be no need to explain itNo,I think in some companies it happens but in some companies they look for problem solving skillsSuppose theres D.P or graphs ques. obviously you cant focus on quality while solving such quesMeans you have to solve it write functions,and you have to think as wellSo they focus more on problem solving skills,But if you used a better variable name then its goodLike if you're giving interview in any company you should keep that in mindBut in that odd even ques you can use and1 ,startups dont say anything about itThere are chances that bigtech companies may not allow it,and say to make code readableBecause there are vast type of people who can read your code,and in startups there are less eng.Yes the way they prioritize product is the way how they are hiringBut making code readable is important in interviewsThank you guys for watching,I had uploaded video on placements at IIT-BHUIf you havent checked it then do check it out,we have discussed about many thingsCollege life,placements,(core,non-tech,tech placements)and non cs and non circuital branchesplacements scene at IIT-BHU so we've talked about it do check it outAnd let me know about your progress and 6more days to go and we would complete it soonSo if you loved this video then do like,suscribe this channelWe will meet in next video,till then bye:)
