all right check this out Vision OS let'ssee how stupid this thing is so this isactually the xcode simulator Applereleased the developer tools for visionOS just yesterday and I thought we wouldtake a look together at what this thingis really capable of and what the UI isgoing to look like and I installed anumber of the sample applications sothat we can get a feel for what's reallypossible with the vision OS and thesorts of applications that apple isimagining that we might develop forexample here's an immersive video one soyou kind of get this transition betweenyour world and then that goes into thisbackground and then you can play a videoif you like and yeah it's just thisbeach thing that they have here thevideo itself here is not immersive inthis situation but let's go back to thebeginning and I'll show you how thisworks so this is the xcode simulator youuse this to develop iPhone apps as welland then yesterday Apple updated this toinclude support for vision OS and youcan see here that you can kind of changethe reality background that you're in sothis is a kitchen view there's also anumber of these other one ones this isthe kitchen View at night so you cantest if your apps are working atnighttime or daytime you've got theliving room view you've got the livingroom View at night and then they alsohave like this Museum view in day andnight mode as well so you can just kindof play with that and then you canactivate the home button in which youcan see all of your apps here so we'lltake a look at these apps in a momentbut you can also navigate through thisscene as well so if I Mouse scroll upand down I can kind of walk through thisscene and of course you can look up ordown using these bottom right controlshere but one interesting thing is thatapple is also supporting the gamecontroller so I plugged in a PlayStation4 controller here and now I can justkind of move through this scene morenaturally so with the controller none ofthe buttons seem to work it's reallyjust the L2 and R2 buttons for going upor down in height and then you have thejoystick controllers for pending aroundand looking about but you know this isjust the xcode 15 beta 2 so they mayimprove this later on so if you comeinto the Beta you can download this aswell this was just released yesterdaybut for now we can check out some of theapps that you've got your settingsyou've got Safari for those if you'regoing to Safari you can actually startsurfing the internet in augmentedreality using virtual reality so you cango to like check out your favorite newswebsites to read about that missingsubmarine you can open up new tabs sowe'll go to like youtube.com as well andso the idea is you can watch these 2Dvideos in 3D and we can even go intofull screen mode here if I click thefull screen buttonyet this is supposed to be full screenhere and you'll notice sometimes there'sthis onboard keyboard that pops up andyou can type letters in here as well andthen one interesting thing is there arethese gestures where you can zoom outand then you can kind of pan around andyou can see all of your other tabs in 3Dand choose the tab that you want to gowith so obviously here I'm just usingthe mouse and keyboard to do thesegestures I'm holding the option key toget this but you know if you had thegoggles on you would be doing real lifegestures like Minority Report stuff andso that's Safari at the bottom of eachwindow you can see there's a handle Ican hold to drag the window around thescene and if I hold shift then I canbring the window closer or further fromme so these gestures of course you canalso do once you have to goggles usingsome natural gesture that I assume andthen you can like walk through thisthing here as well so personally Ireally like this idea of just being ableto walk to certain web pages like Ialways wanted to just feel a websitewith my hand and just get that tangiblequality just being able to just reallytouch the web page I always wanted to dothat and now you actually can and youcan even walk through it and you can seeas you kind of go behind it it becomestranslucent then when you get back infront of it then it takes on fullopacity again so another interesting appactually here is the photos app where wecan come in here and start browsing someof our photos here and you know thesephotos they're not going to be very bigbut if you have a panoramic photo hereso this is a panorama that I tookearlier today of just my apartment youcan actually view the Panorama in 3Dright you can just expand that and itfeels kind of like you're theirs you cansee actually in every scene there's thislittle menu Arrow icon here at the topthis is basically your control panel soyou can just come in here adjust theaudio all these menu icons similar to oniPhones and you can see one interestingthings that I can just place thesemultiple windows all all over the placeso I don't know maybe this is good formultitasking because you can open up allthese windows place them around yourapartment and just look in the directionof whichever app you want I meanessentially your whole entire room kindof becomes this desktop that you canstart working at so I have my calendarthere I've got my web page in the frontI've got photos here and so as Iunderstand if you check theirdocumentation they have this Innovativefeature known as sharp layer basedcontent Envision OS where they willrender the areas in the center of yourvision at higher resolution and then thestuff at the more peripheral areasthey're going to render at lowerresolution so now we'll go to thekitchenjust like that I transported myself tothe kitchen we can check out some ofthese other apps here they've got like aMaps app and let me move the browser tothe side the maps app is basically justa 2d application you know you can walkto it and just kind of browse around theapp yeah some of these apps quitefrankly they just seem pretty pointlessat this point it's just the exact same2D version of the app that you would seeonly now it's in the window in 3D inyour mixed reality but these apps areessentially totally unchanged and maybepeople are still just trying to figureout what a proper use case for this isgoing to be like do you really need yourreminders in 3D maybe not but obviouslythis is only the beginning actually theyhave a few sample applications which wecan load up and check out one of them isthe happy beam application here so thisis kind of this game that they made forus this is this cloud game and you'resupposed to just shoot the clouds so theclouds are drifting towards you and youcan just kind ofshoot at the class and when they show onfinding is I'm always just trying toreposition these windows all the timejust so that they don't get into my viewso that's a simple mixed reality gameokay pretty stupid what else have we gothere you've got this diorama this isanother sample application where you cansee a 3D model in real time so againhere you've got this window here that'spartially obscured I've got to try tomove this out of the way and now thoughwe can see there's this diorama thatthey have available for us I'm going touse my controller to navigate aroundthis thing and actually it looks likemaybe this is Yosemite because you'vegot El Capitan there and you've got somebirds flying around and they've got thisoption here where you can morph theTurin as wellmorph it into like this island here whatelse have we got here the Walmart demoHere is known as the hello world demo sothis one they can actually load up likeplanet Earth objects for you to take alook at so with this you can view aglobego ahead and take a look at that Globerotated around in 3D in real time okayand we've also got objects in orbit hereso this is kind of like a 2d applicationright in this window but then the objecthere is in 3D maybe even walk around ityeah you can kind of walk around thatthing and they've got a moon objectthey've got a telescope object and youcan actually go into the source code bythe way for some of this stuff so let meopen that up and you can see that theybuilt this essentially using Swift UI soone interesting thing is if you go intothe source code we can actually see thatas you're developing they have thispreview pin here so they render yourapplication in real time and as you'remaking modifications it's going to showthe output of that right away maybethat'll make development a little bitfaster for people but one thing new theyhave here is something known as realitycomposer Pro if you open this up it's anew application that basically justhelps to visualize some of the 3D modelsthat you may have so for example there'sthis Earth model here and you can justtake a look at it and here we can seewhat's composed of it's a sphere withthis Earth material you've got a customShader here you've got a cloud pendingspeed a sun angle you've got somevectors and UVS here and then you've gotyour materials here as well you've gotthe telescope model here that you canjust take a look at before you put itinto your scene and then coming backinto the app we've got one more demohere for the solar system you can viewthis in outer space and this is a fullyimmersive view of the earth you can kindof pan around you can see there's theSun out there you've got the Milky Waygalaxy so that's the galactic core rightthere and the whole thing is in 3D andyou know what it just makes you thinkmaybe those people who took thesubmarine down to see the Titanic maybethey should have just used AR insteadright save themselves some time use thisdestination video see if I can findsomething for them here's one oceanbreezeremove this preview thatbut that doesn't seem like an oceanbreeze at alland personally I find all of thesewindows just I mean for me so far thisexperience is just this Mini-Game ofmicromanaging Windows trying to get themnot to block each other so I don't knowif you just really enjoy multitaskingand managing tons of random Windows allover the place which are just blockingeach other then maybe this experiencewould be for you but I kind of thinksome of this is people are still justfiguring out what the application andusage for VR is really going to bebecause let's face it at this point alot of these apps just seem totallyridiculous and useless right like whywould I want my calendar in 3Dright why would I want this in 3D butwho knows right maybe in the future somepeople won't even have laptops maybethey'll just have a goggle VR headsetand that's the only thing they'll reallyuse and so then in that case maybe youreally would want to have all of yournormal applications in 3D here and sothere you go a first look at Vision OSwe can see all of the windows I havepositioned here within this 3D space soprobably really good for multitaskersthe type of people who have like 50 tabsopen at once here's the photos app wecan see this one it's a little dismayedI think that the view is quite smalllike there's no way to really expandthis bigger if I try to zoom in on it itjust zooms within its own window you canplay around with this as well if youlike you just go to Apple's websitedownload the xcode 15 beta and divisionOS SDK you'll be able to build theseapps and download these sampleapplications as well I essentially ranthrough the four sample apps for youalready though and if you want to createyour own app it's pretty simple you justcreate a new project you make a visionOS app give it a name create theapplication and it's essentially sets upthe boilerplate project for your app andso in this scenario the Hello World appwould be the scene with a sidebar you'vegot your content you've got a 3D modelof a sphere here that text hello worldand you know you can just startmodifying this in real time and it'sgoing to just show that in the previewso pretty interesting overall my twosenses this whole exercise in redundancyjust begs the question why like why arewe doing these 2D windows in 3D is didanybody ask for this and is there a usecase maybe this is the future or it'snot the future at all it's also worthmentioning at this point that you don'thave to use Swift UI to develop any ofthese apps there's a separate path inwhich you use Unity so in that case youwould be using unity's toolkit to createmore of these gaming like experiencesmaybe 3D immersive scenes compared to ifyou're using Swift UI xcode and Apple'sdeveloper tools then maybe get more ofan app-like experience with Windowsmenus icons handles and actually that'sone thing I know this just now actuallyis if you have like this photos app andyou want to see it bigger you can eitherwalk towards it or you can actually justdrag this handlebar to expand theviewport which is probably the preferredway to do it so maybe there's a bit ofgetting used to and so I'm stillexploring this but either way it doesseem to open up a whole new landscape ofcreative opportunities where really thesky's the limit play around with it seewhat you can come up with you know myonly hesitation for this as far asdevelopers goes that we're going to havethis entire ecosystem of apps that areyet again crippled by Apple's App Storeonce again and you can bet this appstore is going to be around wherethere's going to be a 30 tax and appleis going to be watching every singleapplication approving or rejecting whatyou can do on there and so what we'regoing to get in the Apple's version ofthis metaverse is probably no cryptoprobably no porn probably a bunch ofrestrictions on what you can and cannotdo and it's going to be this world inwhich is completely reliant ondevelopers like you to help make thisecosystem vibrant and create the appsthat are necessary for this and yet therisk is this becomes another appecosystem that completely cripples thedevelopers eventually growing so bigthat developers have to do whateverApple says they do so my recommendationyou know there's probably going to beanother app store code Rush here buildsome fart apps Flappy Bird apps somestupid games maybe make some X-Ray appwhere it seems like you can see throughpeople make some stupid little gimmickscash in quick and then get out butthat'll do it for me let me know yourthoughts on Vision OS what are you goingto build on here if anything see in thecomments below if you like the videolike And subscribe see you in the nextone thanks bye
