zero work life balance this is a realaspiration engineering for just a lot ofpeople in Tech retail we are regularlysubjects with harassment Best Time Everat this company Apple failure to handleharassment conduct in the workplace notgoodhello hello and welcome back to anothervideo my name is Preston and I'm arecruiter in the technology industry inthis video we're going to check out whatit's like to actually work at Apple oneof the big tech one of the fan companiesthat almost everyone knows about or hasat least heard about but before we getstarted feel free to support a fellowrecruiter give us a like subscribe clickthat Bell really really means a lot butbefore we get started as always pleasetake all these reviews with a grain ofsalt a lot of these are taken fromglassdoor.com from real current orprevious employees I'm excited to dig inlet's check it out so we finally madethe glass store and this is the mainpage for apple as you can see they're agigantic company they have over 10 000employees public company doing over 10billion dollars of Revenue founded in1976 headquartered in California checkthis Audi massive massive shout out toThe Architects and designers I mean lookat this headquarters if I were to workat one company I would love to work hereit's like a futuristic UFO a giantmetallic scientific ring that just likelanded in the middle of California nowyou can also see it was voted the bestplace to work in 2022 and you scrolldown they even have a bunch of GlassdoorAwards so so far they're starting off ona really really good note here but let'sgo and click on reviews there's a littleover 33 000 reviews which is absolutelycrazy out of almost 28 000 full-timepart-time English employees have givenApple a 4.2 out of 5 which is relativelypretty high Lacrosse store 83 wouldrecommend Apple to a friend which isvery high and 91 approve of CEO and TimCook has a little over 6964 ratings nowas always we're going to sort this bypopularity and let's see what people areactually saying we got in environmentalconsultant interesting October 9 2022fairly recent actually it was actuallyuh yesterday the pros incredible peoplewho treat each other with respect theyask for help and you will get itcompletely and they will reassure youthat you have what you need I don't seeany cons wow can sound or look muchbetter than this smart people they treateach other with respect and then if youneed feedback or help they help you outthey give Apple a 4.0 out of five a oneout of in work life balance so I thinkif there's going to be a con here it'sgoing to probably talk about world clockbalance and three out of five out ofculture values career competition andSenior Management it's pretty good don'tknow what this person does theyrecommend CEO proof and business OutlookPros we work with Geniuses literalGeniuses if you want to work and youthink you're a genius go work at Applein every Department we create Innovativeproducts that thrill our customers andcreate new products categories I meanwho else can say that I think in Tech orreally in any company you want to workat a company that has some sort oftangible impact in the world whetherit's like something sustainable climatechange good for the planet type of thingor actually making really awesomeproducts consumable products that yousee just everywhere and obviously AppleI'm filming on my MacBook Pro I have aniPhone and I'm sure a lot of you arewatching this have some sort of Appleproducts whether it's utilizing thehardware or some other software apps ormaybe even their airpods which I lovetoo or the iWatch conszero zerozero work life balance Executives havebeen saying for years if you understandand will make it better but actuality itgets worse every year it is obviouslytop management lip service because if ifthey meant it they could fix it tomorrowthey have hundreds of billions ofdollars in the bank if they really careabout employees work right balance theycould bring aboard the right number offolks to make this issue dissolve sickup hearing lies just don't lie aboutwanting to fix it when they clearlydon't care this was written in 2014 sokeep in mind this is pretty old but notsurprised I mean everyone aspires towork at the big Tech the fangs theFacebook the Apple Amazon Netflix Googlesometimes Microsoft and they're knownjust for amazing office perks andculture and benefits but a lot of peoplealso know that sometimes depending onthe team or company as a whole it couldbe very rigorous and stressful in termsof the culture a lot of it's based onmetrics and performance and if you don'tcut it your job your livelihood can beon the line and so it really comes to nosurprise for me to kind of hear thisthat yes like you're a paid well wellit's prestigious to work at Apple butyou know they expect you to puteverything into the job and as a resultthat will 100 affect your workoutbalance and unfortunately that's what'shappening here what's even moreunfortunate is that you know theexecutives they just do this lip servicewhere they're like hey this is a problemwe're gonna fix it but nothing actuallygets done again this was written abouteight years ago so if you're a currentApple employee or you worked at Applebefore please let me know the thingsimprove or are things actually stillreally difficult this person at homeadvisor ranks it out of five position isat home which is great companies amazingLimitless advancement opportunities youwork with some very cool people and theleadership cares about your developmentand all these are great stuff you mayget coaching but never get battered orbelittle the pay is decent the benefitsinclude 401K match stock purchaseoptions product discounts discounts andservices across many different areaseducation assistance child careassistance paid vacation sick time andother time off options including healthclub reimbursements by costs you get 1.5for overtime and it's pretty muchunlimited as much as long as you don'texceed 12 hours a day so I mean thissounds amazing fantastic benefits overtime a lot of these reviews are forpeople who have a lot of different typesof roles with an apple but for thisperson in particular sounds great theschedule changes every 90 days and youhave to bid for your shift so you neverknow what you're going to get oh thatcould be a little bit nervous ornerve-wracking for a lot of people whoare just on a work schedule that changesa lot you just never know like what'sgoing to happen whether you're going tobe working early in the mornings laterin the days weekends and that can bevery just difficult and anxiety-inducingjust to be able to plan your life arounduh again exactly I just said it makes itextremely hard to plan your life youpretty much have to work Saturday andSundays that's a shame but again youknow for all the pros maybe it's worthit to you the magic consists of a teammanager and the area manager meetingsare held over video and chat they aresupportive and individual development tohelp you reach your goal nice imaginewe'll challenge you if you want advancebut it's always in the spirit of makingyou better sweet all right that soundedpretty good you got a software engineerwritten in 2016. working at apple meansthat things you work on we'll get intothe hands of hundreds of millions ofpeople and I think this is a realaspiration in dream for just a lot ofpeople in Tech but also even otherIndustries you want to be you knowyou're hopeful that one day you'regiving chance to work on a product thatyou can see like your friends are usingyour colleagues using you on the subwayyou commute airport you see people usinglike that is awesome and that just getsyou like really fired up and excitedabout your product it's a lot ofpressure to get things right which isjust you know what we just talked aboutearlier and drives one to do the bestwork of their lives I think a lot ofpressure can either inspire you to pushto do better or for a lot of peoplethey'll start cracking and they succumbto the pressure and then they just getfiltered out which is unfortunate twoand a half years later I'm or no sorry alittle over two years later I'm stillblowing about talent and creativitypeople I work with again no surpriseespecially for someone in recruiting thetalent the process of getting to Appleand all these big tech companies arevery rigorous prestigious it's verydifficult to get in and so people whoare part of the Apple team likeundoubtedly they are great at what theydo there's a reason why they get hiringso if you're there you know you canobviously surround yourself with amazingpeople Geniuses and it just hopefullyinspires you to be a better person orbetter professional con it's a lot ofwork teams are usually strappedresources and Under Pressure to deliveron strict timelines leading to highstress and long hours at certain timesduring the year I get it this is justwhat we talked about you are pluckedfrom the world into the family of Applewas surrounded by Geniuses you'regetting paid really well the perks andbenefits are ridiculous but what's thecatch gotta work hard gotta work reallyreally really hard so make sure thathopefully you end up on a good team ofcourse A lot of it can differ on theteams your higher manager and what youdo at a company like apple but I thinkon the whole like they will just expecta lot from you advice keep fighting forwhat's right renewable energy civilliberties working conditions everythingI can be prouder of that aspect in thiscompany in the end it's about a lot morethan profits and earnings so yeahoverall this is a fantastic review givesApple a 5 out of five the only thingthat's not for at least four is theworkout Balance company as meticulous astheir products their specialist the proscompetitive pay benefits amazing peoplegreat work awesome opportunitiesexcellent experiences great atmospherebeautiful store none cons none Best TimeEver at this company hopefully I stay onthe go to corporate so I think with thisperson they're a specialist at a storeand it seems what it's really cool islike if you do really really well it canpossibly be a ladder for you to get tothe corporate headquarters that's reallycool if you have any experience workingat the store as a specialist or maybeyou have was able to get out of thestorage corporate you know someone who'sdead please share the comments below I'dlove to have to hear about it productspecialist 3.0 Apple failure to handleharassment conduct in the workplace notgood some pros are paid benefits instock but let's look at the cons Applewrongfully terminate an employee whoshowed evidence of them being pursuedand being manipulated and lied to that'sa loaded sentence but that's not a goodone and left that person with noinformation for over three weeks wereasked for any other evidence they choseto fire them without having all theinformation and having misinformationthat will co-worker was terminated withfalse information and misplaced infogiven to Apple they used that person toset an example due to just a few weeksbefore the investigation these are cameout of apple and Apple has failed tohandle harassment conduct that co-workerwas set up and had all the evidence andthey still chose to fire that employeebut the other party involved nothing wasdone to them and they broke businessconduct oh my God the other party sentnudes to a co-worker without askingpursued the male co-worker making itseem like she was interested in andwould Express how she liked them to thenclaim that she was never into them andtheir message was to prove but becausethe man did not make the claim wasmanipulative to thinking it was liketurned on tournament it was underwrongful terms advice actually look outfor their employees there are a lot ofmisconduct that happens in the workplacedaily and no one says a thing people areactually harassed do not know how tohandle it it is not only women but menare actually manipulated too at work andthen used as an example for being set upthis is a very insightful commentbecause yes harassment does happen atall levels at all companies and itdoesn't just happen on one sex it go ithappens to everyone so I think for thatlike this is a very valuable thing toread I think again it's extremelyunfortunate horrible situation where ifa wrong was happened to you then theperpetrator or the person that conductedthat action does not get penalized orkicked out or punished right and so Ithink that would be horrible to moraleto people who are on the team who maybeperhaps observed or seen it happen uhthe behaviors in question it's just nota good luck short term and then if if itbecomes blatantly clear that it's somesort of cover-up is happening maybefavoritism for a certain employee overothers it can get very very complicatedvery quickly and so yes like you knowit's very very important to be fair inthese situations but also you know dowhatever you can that part of theonboarding or HR training that a lot oftrainings clear communication can talkopenly about these situations becauseUnfortunately they happen and when theyhappen people need to know exactly whatthey need to do like how do they reportit how do they communicate it and willthat be in a safe space this personoperation specialist good company valuesnot the best fall through the companystands for a lot of great things helpingthe environment giving opportunities tounderprivileged communities across thecountry more if that's awesome the teamup here is going to be very tight-knitand this is joyous to the people youwork alongside with awesome leadershipcons is subpar oh so this isparticularly across several stores Ihave experienced colleagues mistreatedmore times than I can count in retail weare regularly subject to harassment andabuse from customers little to nosupport there is no commission and noreal opportunity to negotiate pay for acompany worth almost 3 trillion weshould be paid much more especially inFlagship locations I think any job at acompany like apple whether you're at thestore or corporate is of equalimportance and it is important thateverything that an employee wants andbooks for a company basic stuff likeFair wages benefits and PTO should beclearly communicated to everyone and acompany especially like apple that'ssuper high profile or is publiclydisclosed how much money a company Applehas it will undoubtedly get more morequestions if not a lot of that doesn'tget reinvested into the team or if theteam believes that it's just none ofit's going to reinvest or if it is notfor the right purposes and they don'treally see it trickle down and affectingtheir lives or their work so yes I cansee how that will be very very difficultfor morale and for excitement in yourjob and if that's not going to happenmaybe there may see some sort of betterinternal communication as to why it'snot happening right not negotiating withpay or not having the opportunity that'sobviously very very difficult and againharassment and very very difficultsensitive topic that unfortunately doeshappen change can only happen if it getsbacking for the leadership andleaderships don't do anything it's notnothing's gonna happen advice uh listento your employees generally withoutfollowing up with excuses businessintelligent developer this was writtenthis month prestigious for people whodon't work in the company you will getdiscounts on Apple products that'samazing I mean if I got Apple productdiscounts that be absolutely amazing ifthere are any Apple employees watchingthis and be willing to give us discountplease reach out to me cons they did notprovide me a better a better experienceletter after quitting this letter isimportant to apply for i-140 which is aVisa situation this is a big red flag onthe kind of company it is if you're on avisa do not be associated with thiscompany because they will use your Visastatus to abuse you it will not give youany experience letter when you quit thework culture is so bad that you end upworking 10 plus hours per day andmanagement will do nothing to improveconditions and use the Visa as a leash Idon't know too much about visas to talkabout this coffee but my understandingis typically if you're coming from thiscountry immigrated or you just need workas a Visa once you get a Visa transferto sponsored a company it's not like youcan get another job if you hate it liketomorrow unfortunately the company knowsthis and for every visa to be sponsoredor VISA has to go through a process andit can cost a lot of money you can havea lot of time so once that happensyou're typically locked in for at leastseveral years please correct me if I'mwrong and so the best case scenario isthat you get a job and you love it youget get treated fairly get paid well butthe worst case scenario is somehow theopposite happens when a company isabusing you use it as a controlmechanism and then for instance like ifyou end up leaving like this person theydon't really help you get another Visaor help you with that transition andthat could be a very difficult stressfulsituation for someone because if theycan only be in the U.S and only get ajob based on a Visa but then yourprevious employer doesn't help doesn'tprovide the necessary documents ordoesn't even say anything positive orreally want to make an effort to helpyou get another Visa that could mean youmaybe will have a lot of difficultygetting a job and then you know youdon't usually have unlimited time in thestates to find another job that'susually a living amount of time fromwhich if you fail to get another job youmight have to go back to your homecountry so like it's very very stressfulit's other levels of complex complexityand difficulty especially with peoplewho are here working on a Visa my heartgoes out to all the people and I know alot of a lot of amazing talent uh can'tget jobs in the States because it'sstrictly just the Visa situation andthen to now you know understand thatlike a lot of the people don't like thejob they're unhappy or they feel like toan extent they're abused like that'sreally really sad great atmosphere towork iOS technical support advisorposition offers great benefits whileproviding troubleshooting skills thathelp Beyond work managers are helpfulwe'll try to best assist you becomesvery repetitive and we're not in essencemy position is virtual so I was the onlyone in my space I'm Mike uh the othervideos what's really interesting herewith the reviews the popular ones isit's with a variety of different typesof roles not all of them are corporatenot all of them on the stores we're ableto just hear a lot of really cool likehigh level overview from a lot ofdifferent types of jobs within apple onthe plus side as expected like it is agreat place it's very prestigious it'llhelp you on your resume it'll help youin your career you get paid super wellyou get amazing benefits amazing cultureamazing growth uh but again like withany company out there it does have itsissues I think there have beensurprisingly couple posts in this videoabout harassment which is obviously areally Dynamic evolving conversation Ithink without going into it too deep init's very important to be have to offerproper training on these so that peopleknow what the right Protocols are ifsaid situations does happen to them andthen if it happens just I hope itbecomes they do whatever they can toestablish a safe space the people willlisten people will care for them andthen they'll be fairness that happensthe second biggest theme is you'll justwork really really hard so yes do youthink that if you work at thesecompanies like Google Amazon Apple likethis good you can kind of Coast but forfor most people like to be able toaccess the best things about workingwith these companies the catch is youjust have to work really really hard dayin day out and for some of these othertypes of positions maybe in the storesyou're on freelancing you'll have towork on the weekends and it's verydifficult to have proper work-lifebalance with friends and family or justplanning overall just life planning somake sure you take into the account butagain if you worked at Apple you knowsomeone who's dead would love to hearfrom your experience again I have somuch fun making these videos I hope itwas fun enlightening and educational fora lot of you if there are othercompanies you want me to read reviewplease make sure to drop it down belowwe love to make more of these but thankyou so much again and we'll see you onthe next one
