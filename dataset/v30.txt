so i just got off the zoom meeting witha person who just got hired as a qualityassurance engineer or test engineer atapple in our conversation he told mewhat he needed to do to apply and getinvited to an interview how many stepsthere were in the process and what hedid in every single interview thequestions they asked him as well as hisadvice to anybody who is hoping to landa job as a quality assurance engineer atappleand now i'm going to tell you if youwatch to the end of this video i canguarantee that you will be morequalified and more prepared to ace yourinterview with apple and get a job as atest engineerlet's goso first things first what is this jobthis job is a quality assurance engineeror a test engineer and it's basicallyworking in the software side of apple soworking with apple tvsany subscription service apple newsapple fitness etc doing testing ifyou're watching this videoyou probably already know that so whatabout the timeline the timeline wasabout a monththe candidate told me at the verybeginning he applied he went to apple'swebsite applied for a role he alsochanged his linkedin to open toopportunities only recruiters outside ofyour company can see that so do thatchange that on linkedin that wayrecruiters one they get a free messageto email you instead of it costing themanything it is free so people at appleand other recruiters can um can emailyou on linkedin um but from the time hedid that applied it the uh on the on therollum and changed his linkedin to openopportunitiesum he was reached out to and it tookabout a month or so from him to go fromstep one to receiving an opera fromapple now one last note this person iscoming from another big tech company i'mnot gonna tell you what company but itjust from aum you know a comparison sake right ifyou're coming from a smaller company ormaybe you're a recent grad um yourexperience might not necessarily beapples to apples because this person wascoming from a largetech company now the interview processis three main steps the first step isthe recruiter reached outand connected and the first interviewwas a 30 minute audio call now i thoughtthis was really interesting when italked to the the candidate about thisand i asked about his experience um hetold me that there wasn't a lot ofquestions there wasn't a lot of probingit was mostly the recruiter telling himabout the team and about what wasexpected um and then at the end of himkind of sharing all the informationabout the job umhe asked if he was interested and if hewas then he would set him up with thehiring manager but the recruiter didn'treally ask any questions he said it wasa very welcoming interview it was mostlyabout selling him on the opportunity andand you know what would be involved inhis day-to-day and the team and thecultureand then finally identifying are youinterested in moving on now thishappened because it was pretty obviousthat this person was qualified giventheir past experience given what they'vealready done so the recruiter this firstphone screenwas much less about probing and diggingin and a lot more about just a generalconnection identifying yes this person'squalified let me tell them about therole are you interested he was theymoved him forward now that firstinterview was a phone call the secondone is the hiring manager it's also 30minutes long and it is a video interviewso um this happened one week later soone week later the candidate is nowtalking to the hiring manager and theydiscussed the responsibilities basicallyof his current role so he works at alarge tech company so he asked about theproducts he's involved with the teamsthe tools he used and then he gave himthe opportunity to ask questions andthat was that was the majority of it soit wasn't anything where he was reallydigging in in round twoagain it's more so casual conversationtalking about his past experience askingabout his resume uh time and time againwhen i was talking to this candidate hesaid it came back to his resume talkingabout what he had done um so i'm gonnaget to advice at the end but real quickone of the things i would tell you isyou want to make yourself very familiarwith what you have done in your resumeokay if you haven't looked at yourresume and identified what you did ayear ago two years ago three years agoand you're not ready to talk about itthat is going to be a miss for apple youneed to be ready to talk about it thenat the end of the interview he gave umthe hiring manager gave the candidate achance to ask questions and he asked thefollowing questions um he asked aboutthe growthfor the team he asked about the teamsize he asked about work life balance umwhy the roll was open he said he gotthat one for my videos so if you'relooking for questions to ask check outmy 27 video 27questions you can ask in your interviewvideo and that should give you more thanenough but it was a lot about just againcasual conversation talking about hisresume talking about the company andthen giving the candidate a chance toask questions now at the end of that heasked him for his availability for afinal interview so this is a big tellif you reach the end of the secondinterview and the hiring manager doesn'task you for your availability that couldbe a sign that maybe they're not goingto move forward with you um so he askedhim when are you free to do this whencan you do an interviewand he got some availability for him andthen one week later he did the finalinterview now the final interview theycalled it a full loop interview it wassix different 30-minute interviews um itstarted at like a little bit afternoonended right around the end of the dayand they had two breaks in there so itis a bit of a marathon it isliterally six hours of interviewing afew breaks in there um it was the hiringmanager again it was peers of the hiringmanager and then people that the hiringmanager worked with so it was a lot ofpeople who are professional technicaland going through now one of the thingsthat this person said to me that eventhough it was like a very long time hefelt it was a pretty comfortableexperience they were very conversationalyou know they they were very um politewelcomingand there wasn't a lot of gotchaquestions they were reallystraightforward he said it was goodexperience it was a lot about his resumethe stuff he had done in his backgroundand just following up and asking aroundthat now he got a call the next day stepfour and this is the last step therecruiter reached out to him um said heythe response from everybody was verypositive um and they're interested inmoving forward are you interested in inworking at apple and then they they wentto offersowhat i like about apple's process isit's relatively quick interview one weeklater second interview one week laterfinal interview next day they'reactually reaching out to coordinate anoffer now let's get into the questionsthat they asked now when i asked aboutquestions he gave me a handful but firstand foremost what he said is most of thequestions were based on his resume soit's what he's done in his past and thenfollow-up questions right so if you'veworked and you've done some testing onproducts um maybe they're gonna ask youokay tell me about this part of yourresume and then they're gonna follow upwith question after question digging inand again not in a got you type way butmore so just on the details so thebiggest piece of advice he and i aftertalking to him can give you is that youneed to familiarize yourself with thework you have done in prior roles youneed to be familiar with your resumewhat you did in the different spots thedifferent tools you used and i wouldprobably think about some of the biggerimpact projects you were involved in umand literally go through and just kindof type up what those things were sotype like you know i was on this projecttook this long this was the outcome herewas the tools i used here's what iencountered here's what i learned butreally familiarize yourself with yourresume your accomplishments and whatyou've done that would be huge now i'mgoing to give you a few technicalquestions that really stood out to himum again this is a test engineer rolethe first technical question that reallystood out to him that that he was askedand um he said he was a little bitsurprised by but obviously he answeredit well enough because he got the jobwas give me a time when there was norequirement but you still needed to testit how did you handle it now i mighthave butchered that language a littlebit but you're getting the gist of itright they're asking for an example of atime where he was required to do sometesting but there was no requirementshow would you approach that as a testengineer with a blank slate how wouldyou walk into that situation anddetermine the requirements you need totest for the next question kind of theopposite you were given too muchinformation but it's staggered whatwould be your approach to testing soagain these are two very uhdiametrically opposed questions they areopposites but they're both kind ofgetting at the same thing it's yourapproach to testing one where you don'thave enough information two when youhave way too much information and it'snot really necessarily in orderperfectlyso think about these two questions andcome prepared to answer themadditionally he was given a fewhypothetical situations um in which theyasked him to come up with a testing planso the way he put this is if you're atest engineer if you're working inquality assurance these are probablythings you're quite comfortable with andyou're ready to talk about it but i justwant you to mentally prepare yourselfthey're going to give you situations andthey're going to want you to respondtalking about how you would approachthem they're hypothetical but they'reprobably going to be involved in thingsthat you've done in your past or thatyou might be doing an apple have a planon how you would approach testing one ofthe examples he said is you know there'sa login page for the app store how doyou come up with the different scenariossohe mentioned that apple was veryinterestedin a few thingsreally interested in accessibilityusability and scalability so as you'reanswering as you're giving examplesthese are things you want to come inmind if you have experience in your pastin which you can really demonstrateproficiencies in testing for thesespecific things you want to bring themup as examples and be ready forquestions and scenarios specificallyaround these things again i'll say onemore time accessibility usabilityscalability now in the last part i wantto talk about his specific advice sothis is someone whoapplied went through the entireinterview process and got a very strongoffer and here's what he would recommendto future quality assurance engineersand test engineers interviewing at appleso he said one accessibility is criticalaccessibility is critical they askedbehavioral interview questions what wasyour biggest failurewhatever you write in your resume needsto be true and you need to be ready tospeak to it be transparent be honestabout your skill when it comes to yourprogramming languages um if you werenewerto a language or you're a bit of anovicebe candid because they are literallygoing to ask you questions around thatum so there's a few things there tounpack um one accessibility is going tocome up over and over and over againthat behavioral interview question whatwas your biggest failure umi'm gonna give you a quick advice onthat so one use the star method so thatsituation task action result use thatframework to to answer your questionwhat was the situation what was the taskwhat was the action you took and whatwas the result right so what was thefailure specifically to this taskthen follow it up by what you learnedfrom the situation and how you werebetter moving forward right so that'sthe next thing umthis was something i said earlier buti'm gonna reiterate it because he put ithere in his advice be ready to speak tothe different things in your resume itis so critical when you have thingsthere they're going to ask you okay tellme about this what did you do there whatwas the situation you were involved inwhat were those challenges they aregoing to ask about the things on yourresume so be ready to talk about themand lastly be transparenthe literally said to me that they'regoing to ask you about your skills andcompetencies with certain thingsthen they're going to use theinformation you provide themto like assign the difficulty levels ofquestions right so if they ask you youknow how are youum you know it you know with pythonright or whatever but let's just saythat that's you know they ask you aboutyour skill one to ten using python andyou go ten well then you better be readyfor like the hardest python questionsyou can get from like technical peopleat apple right so be candid with them behonest with them if you're a six sayyou're a six because then you're gonnaget six level questions and not tenlevel questions he waspersistent on that he mentioned it a fewtimes so that's something i would takevery seriously he said it was a verypositive experience he said even thoughit was six interviews and that that lastinterview um the third step it was quitecomfortable he then reiterated againdon't exaggerate your skill set becausethey will ask questions around thatand that the vast majority of questionsyou are going to be asked for a testengineer role or a quality assuranceengineer role at apple are around yourexperience and around your resumeone last piece of advice from himbe ready with questions so he had eighttotal interviews right one with arecruiter one with a hiring manager andthen six um in that last um you knowthat last grouping of interviewsevery single person gave him theopportunity for questions and i can tellyou as a recruiterwhen people give you the opportunity toask them questions you better havequestions and you better have good onesand you better have multiple i'm talking5 10 15 right becausewhat does it tell someonewhen you don't have questions preparedonei'm not truly interested in investedbecause anybody who is consideringmaking such a major move would naturallyhave questions or two i didn't prepareneither one of those signals are goodyou don't want to be giving off any ofthose signals so make sure you comeprepared with questions to ask them itmatters there you go if you made it allthe way to the end thank you forwatching
