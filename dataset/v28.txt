[Music]hello everyone we are back with anotherround of touring Dev talks and today I'mso excited because today talks is aboutiOS development and I will be talkingwith David zampier about iOS okay and uhto give you a little bit of contextabout David has over six years ofexperience but for the past four to fiveyears he's focused on iOS development sowithout further Ado hi David D how areyou doing and how is your day doing sofarhey Jose thank you for having me I'mreally excited to be here today talkingto you about the iOS development so yeahthis is uh I'm doing great thank you andlet's talk about it nice so could youplease uh introduce yourself and talk alittle bit about your experience withiOS what kind of project have you beendoingso yeah I've worked for a lot of uhinteresting projects like uh worldwidebaggage tracking like for lost baggagesin airports also for streaming appsum and social networks so yeahso cool project a lot of cool projectsnice nice all right so and the firstquestion that I have to you today iswhat is WWDC and what happened thereoh yeah so wwc is the worldwidedeveloper conference it's a conferencethat Apple uh where Apple shows all thenew features for the new iOS version ithappens on June it's a whole week ofstockings and we can talk with uhairport Engineers we canstudy the new documentations we havesome uh working sessions andwhere Apple introduces the new featuresfor us developers so this year we hadlike the new Apple announced the newernavigation API for Swift UI so we canlike build the navigation for our appsin Swift UI more easily so we have thenew widgets for lock screen so if youare using the new iOS 16 you can youprobably have seen it and you can likeuh buildum custom widgets for the lock screen uhus as developers so also we have thelive activities and like screen lockscreen as well and all of these featureswere introduced by Apple in www.dc thisyear and and they likeum touch taught us how to build them forour custom apps nice nice and what islive activities on lock screen what kindof features we have thereokay so a lot of activities uh Appleintroduced this year so basically we canyou can see uh real-time updates fromyour app from your locked screen so likefor Rideshare apps orum some you can see the score of a livegame in your lock screen so it's reallyinteresting and also it worked in thedynamic Island introduced by Apple inthe new iPhone 14 pro and 14 pro Maxand so if I have my own API can I I seedata in my lock screen from my own APIsure for sure yeah you can do it in yourapp all right so that is amazing socould you please tell our audience uhhow you're working at touring has beenso faroh it's it has been amazing like I'veknown people from many cultures frommany countries and this is great becauseI have opportunity to connect to peoplefrom all the worldand uh I've been working for a companybased in California and they are amazingthey have like great Engineers there andI had opportunity to be there a coupleof weeks ago to know the the the companyuh headquarters and to connect to myteammates and it was awesome did youtravel to us last last week also yeahyeah all right that's amazing yeahthat's that's so nice all right so intalking about iOS okay the firstquestion that I have for you is so I useiOS I used to develop for iOS long uhyears ago long time ago and I useObjective C okay and is objective c isstill using nowadays or they are usingonly Swiftyeah so for new features and newprojects we are only using Swift andsf2i maybe but because uh objectivity Chas a great interoperability with swiftso if you have like a code reading likea few years ago you can like itcommunicates with Swift in a great wayso we're not using objectives anymorejust for like old projects but we arestill migrating from your objectivity toserve because it's way better in myopinion nice and yeah and do you thinkthat it's important for developers toknow objective see if they want to startin this world or they they must startwith Swift and then go onI think they can start with swiftnowadays because as I said they're likethe new projects and the new featuresthat we're current building like theyare all in Swift but there are someprojects that still use this objectivityso maybe at some point they will need tolike study a little bit aboutobjectivity but for starters I thinkit's probably the best way to start withswift just to understand a little bitrightyeah all right all right all right soum could you pleaseum explain me okay what what are themain difference between uh you createone application for Apple watch for Maxand for Apple TV and for iOS and so onfor exampleyeah so uh basically we can use appleuses Swift for all of its platforms likeuh iOS that it's the the OS for theiPhones for watch OS for app watch theTV OS that it is for Apple TV sobasically we can like for iOS we canbuild an app for iOS and it can runshare the code with the Apple watch orthe iPads or even with the Mac OS so wehave great uh thingsum a great ways to like share the codebetween all the platforms from Applenice really nice all right and whatcould you tell me about uh deep link uhin iOS what's deep linkwell so deep links uh there are linksthat are used to send users like directto a point of your apps for screen orsomething like that soumApple introduced us the universal linksthat's a new approach to connect yourweb pageso we are uh to our app under the samelink so if you click to a universal linkand your app was set up with this newthis new Universal link API so insteadof if you don't have that installed onyour iPhone you'll be redirected to yourlike the App Store so you can downloadthe app and open the app right on thepage that you are looking for that'snice so let's suppose I am on touringwebpage website and then to the says uhdownload our app and then when I clickin this link it will try to it willcheck if I have this uh app installed inmy device if not it will redirect to uhApple Store in the app page when I clickand download it will download and openthe the app is thatyeah yeah basically that it's amazingnice all right next question I have foryou okay uh what is gcd uh gcd and iOSin generalokay so DCd stands for Grand CentralDispatch it's a low level API thatenables users to run concurrent taskslike a currentsimultaneously by managed tradingsthreatens in the background so today wehave uh lots of complex apps that needsto run simultaneous tasks so the the gcdit's a apple solution to build theconcurrency and parallelism into iOSapplications and so you can run multipletasks in background simultaneously andthis will not affect like the mainthread or your main app so you can stillusing like your features while otherthings are currently are happening inthe backgroundall right okay got that butum so how we can achieve uh concurrencein iOS so is that the only way to dothat or there's or is there any otherpossibilityokay so basically we have three ways toachieve the concurrency so one of themare the dispatch queues so they are usedto manage uh tasks like my fifth orderfirst in First South where they canbasic execute it sequentially orconcurrently this is an easy way tohandle a secret a synchronous tasks inyour application you know so the secondway we can use threads so we can start athread and like uh run a code in thisseparated thread and it will run uhconcurrently with the main traged thatof that or your app can have like manythreadsand having a threat is special it'suseful uh when you need to perform uhsome tests that it will take a long timeto to run you knowand we have also the operation skillsthe operation queues they are high levelabstractions they were built on top ofthe gcd that we talked before and it ispossible toexecute tasks like concurrently justlike this the gcd but in object-orientedmannerall right so then I have two dummyquestions for you okay I hope you don'tkill me about this question but yeah sofirst questionum what happened when you put our app inbackground for example if I'm using 2Dapp and then I just uh swiped up andthen go to the main page what what whathappened and what what can I do thereokay so basically when you put your appand background uh the main thread it'slike suspended and the backgroundthreads can uh perform some actions thatyou are explicitly say to perform so youcan uh continue using the user'slocation for Rideshare apps uh ininstance so also you can have like somekind of synchronization with yourum background back end or if you or withyour API but you cannot perform likehave your uh have tasks like thatdemands among a lot of power or energyor processing from your app from the iOSyou know yeah and how much time our webcan stay in the backgroundso it's defined by the iOS the iOSdefines how much time your app can stayalive in backgroundit depends on your available memory theprocessing the app that is currently inthe in the foreground like is runninguh active at the same at the time youknow so it's defined by the iOS allright in my second question for you iswhat's the difference between app ID andbundle IDokay so the bundle ID is uh it's theunique identifier for applications inthe whole apples ecosystem so we havethe bundle identifier for your IOS appthe bundle identifier for youruh watch OS app for your Apple TV app sothey are for the whole Apple system uhthey use it they are used to reckon justto recognize your app and for updatesand this kind of stuff and the app IDit's a string that uniquely identifiesone or more apps from the samedevelopment team so we have uhdevelopment teams for the Appledeveloper and uh this string the app IDhas two components the team ID and yourbundle ID from your appgot you so so if you have oneapplication that runs in my my cellphone and another one that runs my Applewatch so how can I set up it and toidentify they are the sameyeah so we will need to set a differentbundle identity a different bundleidentifier for your iOS targets we callit Target so we have the iOS Target andthe watch West Target so we you can setthem separately different they must havedifferently okay bundle with twodifferent bundle ID and when it comes tothe app IDtwo different twoyeah exactly because you get the bundleID and the team ID the team ID will bethe same but the bundle ID will bedifferent all right so in terms ofperformance uh what techniques we canapply in our app to improve theperformance or the user the the managingmemory and stuff like that in ourapplicationokay so well we can do a lot of thingswhile we are creating a new featuredeveloping our code so we can use likeuh multiple threads I start processingdifferent threads or background threadsso we can do uh some hard work uh in thebackground or if you have to do lots ofAPI calls you can use uhsimultaneously using concurrency alsoyou can use uh lady prop lazy propertiesand a lot ofstuff nice nice and speaking about lazyproperty what's lazy propertyokay so the latest properties areproperties who's the initial value isn'tcomputed until the first time they areused so you just need to include a ladya lazy a modifier to your Declaration ofyour property and this lets uh this willdelay the initialization theinitialization of this property so thisis a a good thing tosave your memory or save energy becauseif you have a property that needs to dosome kind of uh uh work hard work or youcan reduce this unnecessary work likeyou know so it will be computed justwhen you use it in your code your callit your function or something like thatnice nice all right and when it comes todesign pattern okay do you think designpatterns are important nowadays if sowhat design pattern are they using andif not what should they dookay so I think design patterns arereally important for most uh all the thesoftware development because it allowsus to uh make our code moreunderstandable and you can add morefeatures in an easy wayand specifically for iOS development youcan use a lot of different designpatternsum sowhen for the UI kids apps uh Applealways like tried to use the MVC themodel of your controller uh it's wherewe can like have mainly three componentslike the view uh the controller and themodelum the view is what the user sees uh thecontroller it's everything that controlsthis view or get information for it andthe model are your models for your appandwe have the mvvm that's commonly usedfor the new Swift UI where we have themodel view the model where the model isare the models from your app the view iswhat your user sees and the view modelis what connects your viewto your model that's why it's calledview model but for iOS we can use lotsof other design patterns like Singletonuh Builder and many others got you andwhen it comes to testing okay what arethe best practice in terms of testingyour applicationis DDD bdd any of this design pattern orthese techniques use it or is thereanother one that you recommendoh yeah so tdd is really important touse I think in my opinion because itallows us to plan the features and buildthe features already with your tests sobasically we will we start developingyour feature by the test so you createyour tests let them fail because youdon't have your classes yet so and thenyou implement your code and you run thetest and if your test passes you canimprove your code and this is amazingbecause uh we can gain sites into bothquality of the implementation if it iswork and the quality of design if it'swell structured and it's a good a goodcode that you have reading you know allright yeah I totally agree with you sotdd is really important not only todebits as much as you test yourapplication you will avoid furtherproblems believe me yeah all right andand the next thing that come to my mindis to talk about complexion handle okayuh what's completion Handlerwell uh completion hinders uh arebasically just functions passed asparameters to other functions so they'reusing to dealing with response of asynchronous task since we we do not knowlike when it will end so we use acompletion Handler to perform uh anactual after your asynchronous code wasuh uh was run and but now we have thenew synchronous uh the swiftestsynchronous API that we they introducedthe async uh await keywords where youcan like uh using them you don't need touse the completion handles anymore niceyeah it's pretty uh pretty similar whatthey are doing with uh c-sharp andJavaScript as well so you can just thinka way to introduce that in JavaScriptand that's pretty great all right andbefore we go to our next question Iwould like to open our developers outthere and if you have three places ofexperience and they are confident withyour text tag go to touring.com I'll putthe link into the description sectionbelow okay go to touring.com create yourprofile there search for the job thatare suitable for your text tag and whenyou find it you can apply for that allyou need to do is pass in the touringfetching process once you completeeverything process you get a job 100remote and as we did okay if you enjoyedthis content please consider to give abig fat thumbs up for this video andcomment down below uh what kind of talksyou would like to have uh to see in theupcoming video if you are not subscribedsubscribe to our YouTube channel uhclicking in the bottom below and comeback to you David what do you understandokay what could we tell us about Dynamicdispatchokay so in simple terms Dynamic dispatchmeans that the program designs decidesat the runtimewhich implementation of a particularmethod or function it needs to invoke inthe case where a subclass overrides amethods or if it's upper class Dynamicdispatch there means determines whetherto invoke the subclass implementationof the method are the parents it takesmore time like it it makes your code alittle bit slower using the dynamicdispatch okay so previously we talkedabout async await right which were agreat addition in iOS developing the iOSworld and so but I think I wait is foruh can I say for asynchronous operationsor asynchronous tasks right but uh ifthey are starting with iOS from now okayfrom this video what do you understandabout the difference between synchronousand asynchronous tasks in iOS how can weexplain it to our audienceokay uh so for synchronous tests uh theyare performed one at a time therefore uhother tests must wait until the previoustask is completed before continuefor a synchronous tasks there runssimultaneously in the background so ifthe if background texts are completedyou'll be notified and a synchronousprogramming allow us to process moodproquests at the same time so you canaccomplish more tests in a shorteramount of time you know okay let me seeif I get that so uh synchronous tasksmeans it will be executing in the mainthread and then it go one by one let'ssuppose you have a table uh with 10lines and then you want to uh iterateover this table it will be executing themain thread and you go for line one andthen do whatever we need to do then linetwo then line three line four and thenso on correct but asynchronous meansthat it will be executed in a differentthread or the same thread as wellbecause this is I'm a bit confused sodifferent threads and then I can go foruh execute that I can read the 10 linesat the same times in different in in 10different process and when it processeach process finish it will send me amessage is it like thatokay so the synchronous test notnecessarily will beum uh run in the main thread I mean youcan start like a synchronous synchronoustasks in a background thread so it is itis possible and for the a synchronoustest they are start they start at thesame time I mean like one doesn't onetest don't need to wait to the othertest to finish so all of them start atthe same time in different queues and wecan like start for all of them to finishto continue our code you know you canget notified when all of them arefinished oh got you so then I havefollow-up questions so we wait we willbe notified when all of them uh finishprocessing or one when each one so ifyou want finish we will be notified andthen another one thing to be notifiedyou can have both behaviors it dependson your implementation but you can getthat fire when all of them are completedor when a specific one is completed niceall right yeah you clarify my mind thankyou all right and as that said that wasmy last question and then I just want toask you if you have anything to add okayuh resource did that if they areinspiring to be a iOS Developer like youand work at tutoring where they canlearn uh what they could learn about iOSwhat what's the best place to learnabout iOS well so we have a lot of uhthings on the internet so I mean we havethe Apple documentation we have a lot ofgreat uh blogs like uh talking about iOSdevelopment so they are great resourcesfor us to understand and to learn aboutiOS development in general in thecommunity community is really great youknow with this we come to the end thankyou Dave for this amazing talk okay thatwas my pleasure to talk with you todayoh thank you Jose it was a pleasure uhbeing here today talking to you thankyou for everythingcool I hope to see you again soon okayand to everybody else so don't forget tosubscribe to our Channel okay
