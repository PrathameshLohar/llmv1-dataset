Apple has a rather intense interviewingprocess and in today's it I'm going totry to give you some insight when itcomes to the types of non-technicalquestions that you are likely to getasked during such an interview and forsimplicity of use I categorized thesequestions into around seven categoriesinto which I'll that that I'm going tocover next and I'm gonna talk about eachcategory about how what are some of thebest practices to answer these types ofquestions the first category isquestions around decision making andhere are three examples of suchquestions tell me about the toughestdecision you have to make in the pastsix months or tell me what the time whenyou have to deal with ambiguity or tellme about the time we faced a problemthat had multiple possible solutions nowwhen dealing with with ambiguoussituations or problems that had multiplesolutions what the interviewer is reallylooking for here is clarity of thoughtin other words not only you should thinkof a situation that was ambiguous werechallenging into it the the solution wasnot clear-cut but also you shouldideally clearly explain the steps thatyou took and the pros and cons of ofthat of that given situation and ofcourse you know more often than not it'snot only us that have to take part inthe decision-making process but we weshould also take advice from externalsources once we've consumed all theavailable information there so thiswould be some of the main elements thatyou would want to consider to have acoherent Starr answer that that wouldsatisfy an interview when it comes todecision make your ability tobe an effective efficient decision makeranother interesting category here wouldbe curiosity like tell me about the timewhen you were new on the job and how doyou go about learning the new tools ofthe trade so this is when an interviewerideally wants to see how do you howquickly can you ramp up your performancein a row and how quickly can you becomean efficient team player ideally so keepin mind that the level of energy is alsoa very relevant aspect when it comes toshowcasing your curiosity unless ofcourse you can remember this keyword tomention every now and then during theinterview next are success stories forexample tell me about a team projectthat you worked on or tell me about thetime and you exceeded your expectationsnow why would someone ask you successstories in job interview well actuallyit's more common than you think to beasked such questions and actually callthese types of questions that giftsgifts because you know they give you aunique opportunity to showcase toadvertise yourself and even moreimportantly to advertise on yourstrengths and if I'd ask you right nowwhat's your core strengths I think youyou you will take a couple of seconds ifnot minutes or more to identify yourcore strengths while going for for sucha role so that's why ideally not onlyyou would want to prepare your successstories in advance but also think aboutyour core strengths and what would bethe best way to present yourself in away that would differentiate you fromother candidates in a job interview solong story short prepare success storiesthe next category here is dealing withdeadlines or delivering results withinwithin fixed constraints timeconstraints and probably the mostrepresentative question here would betell me about time when you fail todeliver something significant on timewhich is a pretty well-known faceyour question so in a job interview in abehavioral job interview with anyhigh-performing company especiallyduring the on-site one it is extremelyunlikely for them not to ask you atleast one failure story because ideallyI would I would encourage you to preparethree to five such failure stories foran on-site interview but this fail ifthis failure stories can come in manydifferent flavors and one of them is youknow and if fail to deliver somethingsignificant on time and there's too manyreasons why someone would ask you for afailure story the first is they want tosee if you have a genuine story a recentone proper failure to deliver somethingon time the second one what you learnfrom it how you grew from this failureso these are the core elements but Ihave better videos on this channelentire videos in which I explain how doyou go about brainstorming for for suchfailure stories and also tuning up youranswer tuning up your failure answers sothat it's it becomes a better one interms of scoring high in the context ofa behavioral interview now a majorcategory of question is you know dealingwith difficult situations or withconflict but you know to be said it canalso mean bad failures and other stuffbut you should expect questions of timeswhen you when you struggled to getsomething done and there are a ton ofexamples of such questions give me anexample of the time when you face theconflict while working on a team and howdo you handle that or tell me about thetime when you receive negative feedbackfrom your manager how did you respond ortell me about the situation where I hadto solve difficult problem or tell meabout the time you failed and what youlearn from it or what is the last timewhen is the last time when you had toapologize to someone or tell me aboutthe de minimis turn of the solution to aproblem now with these types of dealingwith difficult situations it's it's notit's on one hand it's important to findproper scenarios like two or threechallenging projects it's everyone hasthese types of projects butI found even more interestingly it's notas much about finding these types ofstory but how you communicate them thatreally makes the difference with thesethings and by how I communicate them isnot necessarily that you must be anatural storyteller from that but youmust communicate the company in such away that it makes sense both that it wasa real conflict a real struggle there areal failure right or a real apology tosomeone and then to to showcase yourselfas someone who genuinely invested a lotof effort a lot of resources and did nothesitate to look up to look up forexternal help whenever whatever neededto to do so in order to have asuccessful resolution of this or assuccessful as possible because you knowfailure I wouldn't recommend it the turnof failure into into a success story butthe the most efficient answers the bestanswer that I've ever heard about insuch a context are also the ones thatare the the most clear or clearlycommunicated the next category I want totouch upon here is interpersonal skillsand here are some examples give anexample when you soak you're strugglingand decided to step in and help or whatdid you do when you need to motivate agroup of individuals or give an exampleof when you had to push back to H yourchallenge decision we've all had to workwith people that don't like us how doyou do with someone that does not likeyou now these interpersonal skills areneedlessly an important aspect of a jobinterview for a major corporation thatputs a lot of emphasis in working inteams but how would you go about whatwould be a framework that you would wantto maybe employ here now to give yousome clues whenever whenever you have acomplicated situation with someone forexample when someone doesn't likeyou or whenever you had to push back orchallenge the decision you know you mustensure that the communication path isclear and that you listen at first towhatever they want to say and continuingon the same framework that the firststep would be to listen to whatever theywant to say and this would be also inorder to understand what they say tohave clarity of thought but also toultimately earn their trust or regaintheir trust and this this would be oneframework that I found particularlyefficient in showcasing yourinterpersonal skills now of course youknow that whenever you are speakingspeaking announcer out loud there'sthere's primarily that the functionalelements of of that situation like forexample when you push background to aidyour challenge the decision you have topresent the situation step by step momaevery milestone of that process and howhe eventually succeeded but that is onlya part of the answer so if you go thatroute with only the functional elementsit's you're not likely to touch too muchupon the interpersonal skills that youexhibited there but by considering alsothe other side the listening part inorder to gain their trust if you canmanage to also embed this part into youranswer I believe it will be I'm actuallyquite confident it will be a moreefficient answer and you will basicallytell them what they want to hearultimately here besides besides havinghaving a proper story for your answer soI very much encourage you when speakingin this context I mean the person'sgusto to not forget to to showcase thisthis framework of listening in order toearn trust earn someone's or a group ofindividuals trust may be the mostimportant category of questions in anApple interview is unsurprisingly theones related with customers because youknow Apple is a customer centriccompany after all and here are someexamples of such questions tell me aboutthe time any major customer was pleasedwith your service or tell me about thelongest time he took it to conclude thedeal with the customer or how do youshow your customer obsession or tell meabout the last time a customer got upsetwith you now of course you know you youalways want to show us treating yourcustomers well and listen to listeningto them and basically going above andbeyond to make sure they're happy butremember here you're applying for ahigh-performing company so there must bemore than this and something in in issomething that these interviewers arelistening for is also to see on whetherhow you represent your company's bestinterest as well not only ensuring thatyou please the customer as much aspossible so when you're brainstormingfor such situations into which you youdealt with customers in particularsituations try not only to showcase onhow you answered you want above andbeyond to to satisfy customer needs butalso how you ultimately played in yourcompany's best interest and somethingyou might also want to consider is isalso Apple's mission statement and corevalues and to ideally link that customerstory with this larger context and withthis higher purpose because you knowApple has any large platform companythey like hiring people that that aremotivated by a sense of higher purposeso this is what you would ideally wantto showcase within your customerobsession context and finally why Appleand this is a question that I couldeasily write an entire book on becausethere are so many ways that you could goabout answering it the best answers thatI know are the spontaneous ones that youknow make me the candidates that make merelate to something in their lives it'sit's the ones that that impressed me themost with their answers but there's alsothe more standardized approaches whereyou would want to have a more templatedanswer that I want to work at Apple fora couple of reasons and you praise upall you've talked about yourdifferentiators and then you would wantto mention what's in for you or where doyou see yourself in a couple of yearsdown the road there there are many waysto go about this question and you knowfor a phone interview can only go as faryou can only go this far because youknow don't have weeks to invest intothis process but if you happen to toprepare for an on-site interview it'sinevitable that you're getting going toget asked these questions so I very muchencourage you to spend some time to tuneup to see what works best in your casewhat's your best why Apple here and youknow it's very hard for me to give youexamples because there are so many rolesand it your answer if I give this toomuch information here I'll probably runinto the risk that you would end uptemplating your own answer which wouldactually make it sound less interestingbut if you say there's also you shouldknow that the the more relatable youranswer is the more the person can relatewith your specific experience with yourwhy Apple the better it will sound thebell the more motivation one will feelwith this and the standard way wouldalso always be to fill in some templatethere which is not a solely bad thingdon't get me wrong so there you go thisis my categorized list with the moreinteresting questions non-technicalquestions asked in in Apple interviewsmaybe let me say once more that the wayyou'd want to use this list is tofurther tune-up your behaviorinterviewing skills and not as astarting point not as an introduction tobehavioral interviewing
