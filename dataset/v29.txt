to stick around to the very endto hear all of the questions that wayyou have the answers to the questions inthe test before you even take itall right let's start now first andforemost here's what they're looking forthey're looking for interest and passionin the brand overallthat's what they're looking for a formerapple store employeesummed it up to succinctly by sayingthey look for three thingsthey look for enthusiasm personalityand approachability and it all makessense right enthusiasm for the brandpassion around what it is they dopersonality somebody who people want toengage with connect withand can build miniature little microrelationships with during their processand finally approachabilitythey want people that when you know whenpeople come into the apple storeyou're someone they feel comfortabletalking to asking questions sharingconcernsthat is what they look for that is whatmakes a successful apple employee intheir retail storenow let's move to what they don't lookfor they're not looking for fanaticsthere is a difference between passionand enthusiasm and someone who isobsessed with appleobsessed with steve jobs that's not whatthey're looking for a lot of people gointo the interview assuming that youneed to be some sort ofcrazed super fan to land that job thatis not what they're looking forthey're looking for somebody who has thetechnical umability to actually solve these problemssomeone who is technical in natureand has those personality traits are youpassionate are you enthusiastic are youfriendly are you approachablethat's what they're looking for not asuper fan now i'm going tostart describing their process theprocess basically is broken down intothree things first there's a phoneinterview on that phone interview it's20 minutes with a recruiterum this is something where if youapplied you might get into the processor if you go to a career fair and signup in a sheetpeople have also been contacted that waywhere they go hey saw that you shined upata career fair here or a job fair we wantto schedule an interviewthat interview is only going to takeabout 20 minutes it's going to be quickthey're going to go over your backgroundyour interestspecifically and i'm going to teach youhow to answer this question later inthat portion of the video but they'regoing to ask youwhy apple and they asked this for all oftheir positions i've actually done avideo on how to be like a softwareengineer and how toland a job at apple corporate now thisis apple retailbut they both still ask why apple isincredibly important i'll teach you howto answer it laternow the next step is on-site interviewsnow this could be onetwo or three on-site interviews this iswhere you're meeting with potentiallymultiple hiring managers it is notuncommonfor you to meet with multiple hiringmanagers maybe multiple shiftsand then they will collectivelydetermine where you fitand then finally they also do groupinterviews so they do anon-site group interactive interview nowthey do this for a few reasonsthis includes role-playing and they'rethere trying to judge yourinterpersonal skills but it's not umit's not uncommonfor them to actually go through sellingrole-playing selling an apple watchselling an ipad and going throughand while you won't know all thespecifications well you won't know theirprocesseswhat they are looking for are those corecustomer serviceapproachability and passion skills thatare ultimately going to make youa good fit and a good candidate for therole so very high overview of theprocessyou're looking at a phone screeninterview with a hiring managerpotentially a couple of themand then finally a group on-siteinteractive interview experience whereyou're doing role-playingthat at a very high level that's whatyou're looking forand that's what they'll be doing in theinterview processi want to talk about values next becausevalues are incredibly important to appleif you go to their websiteand you look at the about us or valuesection they actually have them listedout they have their definitionsi would recommend that not only do yougo and do your cursory research on applerecent events and all that stuff butspend some time investinglooking at their cultural values now i'mgoing to share them with you here but doyourself a favorevery single time you have an appleinterview before you go ingo to their website bookmark this pageand read through like read through andfamiliarize yourself with their valuesagainwhen companies dedicate an entire webpage to their values and they havedefinitions and you can actually clickon them and learn more about itthat should tell you it's incrediblyimportant to them and it's not somethingfor you to skim over but instead becomefamiliar withnow their values are accessibilityeducation environment inclusion anddiversityprivacy racial equity justice andsupplier responsibilitythose are all incredibly important tothem but i also want you to rememberthis as aninterviewer because when you'reinterviewing it's not only that you wantto know these but you want to exemplifythese rightthey're looking for people who can dothis role and can serve their customersbut also are going to have valuealignment and be a culture fit withappleso i think it's important just to goover these we're about to move into thequestion and answers for the interviewbut as you're answering these questionsthink about weaving some of thisin you know when you're talking abouteducationyou know you're educating theirpotential customerswhen you're talking about um you knowsupplier responsibility that'sincredibly important because it comes tosourcing the parts that they useand what they put in their product andechoing that to their customers talkingabout how that's importantand accessibility they want their theirproducts to be accessible to everybodyso these are just things that it isimportant for you to rememberas you go into the interview now let'sgo into what most of youprobably came for um and that's the thequestions you're going to beasked and then how you can go aboutanswering themsuccessfully now i've broken this downinto three different three differentparts we're gonna go over justa high level question um just say like ablanket question that everybody's gonnabe askedwe're going to go into personalityquestions so questions they specificallyask about your personalitytraits and then finally we're going totalk about some of the behavioralinterview questionsthose are last make sure you stickaround for them i have a specificstrategy that are going to help youanswerall the behavioral interview questionsyou get for the rest of your life butyou'll specifically be able to use themfor this interview with applenow the high level question is why appleand honestly if you can't answer thisquestioni kind of wonder why are you eveninterviewing for thisum anytime you interview with a companybe able to answer whythat company it's incredibly importantpeople want to hire people who arepassionatenot just about any job but their job notjust about any companybut their company so when you're talkingabout apple umthis is what i always say when when iwhen i answer this question i helppeople answer this question50 of it should be about the specificjob you're going to be doingthe task right i like helping people i'mreally passionate about apple productsand theability to help people find their waythrough their products and select whichrightwhich one is right for them would beexciting to me or helping peoplesolve the specific issues so i can maketheir productmore effective for them i would findthat incredibly motivating so half aboutthe specific joband then half of the answer should beabout the company you knowcompany um product why the companyinspires you or company valuesright 50 the job 50 of the company sowhen you're asking that whatever you doput the you know whatever um whateveryou specificallydecide to focus in on make it a littlebit about the actual jobmake it a little bit about the companyand you will nail this interviewquestionall right let's get into the personalityquestionsthese ones are really interesting but umyou know just in the next two to threeminutes i'm going to teach you how toanswer all of thempretty much flawlessly now the firstquestion is what frustrates you the mostthe key here the absolute keythe thing you need to remember is thatit can't be something that you're goingto need to do in the jobso if they said i'm going to give you aterrible example first okay they go benum what frustrates you the most and i gowell i really hate it when people can'tsolve their own problemswell that's not a good answer you'regoing to need to solve people's problemsorif i say something like i hate it whenpeople don't do research on their ownwell that's that's bad people are goingto come in there without doing researchand you're going to need to askquestions and probe to find out which ofapple's products best serves themso that's what you don't do so let'stalk about what you doum so given their valuesand inclusion being one right what agood answer to this interview questionmight beyou know in work one of the things thatfrustrates me is working with people whoaren't open to the idea of othersum i've worked with people in the pastwho tend to be really focused on justtheir own ideasbut they aren't as interested in hearingwhat other people have to say and ithink when you have that mindset you doyourself at a service because i thinkthere's a lot of value and diversity ofthoughtboom there you go that's how you answerthat question if you answer thatquestion if you say thatum i i think you know they're gonna lovethat answer you're crush itum let's go to the next question thenext question is what would you changeabout yourselfthis one's really interesting it'sintrospective umhere's a good answer you might saysomething like you knowi only speak one language but i think ifi could change something about myselfone of the things i think would bereally interestingis if i could speak multiple languagesum and thenbonus point here um if you're doing thatso you could follow that up with sayingyou know right now i i recentlydownloaded uh downloaded due lingo andi've actually been working on learningspanishi just think it'd be interesting i knowit's good for your brain and i think itwould be a good way for me tolearn more about another culture andperhaps connect with different peoplethat is a great answer i meanconsidering you're going into a rolewhere you're going to need tocommunicate with different people withdifferent perspective different walks oflifeand you're expected to help them andwant to help them this is a great answerto this questionbut basically make it something that isin alignment with apple's core valuesremember you're not just answering aninterview questionyou're answering an interview questionfor apple so your answersshould be geared towards apple but thatright there that's a great way to answerthis interview question let's go to thenext the next question isis uh it's an oldie but a goodie kind ofso this is actually something that wheni did my last apple videoum you know how to get a job at appleand this again is apple corporatethey asked this too and it says if youwere an apple productwhich would you be the key here is itactually doesn't matter which one youareit's not like oh if you say apple watchthat's a bad answer it better be iphoneit's not like thatthe key is you've got to know which oneit isand why and and have a reason so justknowwhich one it is and be and you know havea good reason as to speak to why this isthe one you want to benow quickly i'm going to define what abehavioral question is because i thinkthat's helpful a behavioral interviewquestionis basically a question that starts tellme about a time whenwhat the interviewer is trying to makeyou do is look backinto your history and not speculate onhow you would actbut give an actual example of how youhave handled a situationit gives them a window into yourbehavior how you problem solve how youdeal with issuesum and it's not speculative you've donethis sointerviewers see it as more accurate nowbefore we get into thisthis is how you answer a behavioralinterview question again anytime someoneasks you a question where it starts withtell me about a time when or give me anexample whenwhen they're forcing you to recall aprevious example follow the star methodso start situation taskaction result that is a framework and itallows you toanswer a question in an efficient andeffective mannerstart with a situation this was asituation i was intask this was a task i needed tocompleteaction here's what i specifically didto um to to you know have a positiveoutcomeand the result here was the end resultof everything i just walked you throughthis allows you to quickly efficientlyand effectively answer a questioninclude all the relevant details and notramble on okayso that's how you answer like everybehavioral interview question for therestof your life let's get into the one thatapple asks you now the first questionis such a common one it's a it's aclassic and like people are gonna askthis at a ton of different companiesbut tell me about a time when youreceive negative feedback from your bosshow did you handle it now the key hereis make it somethingauthentic right but also not somethingterrible like oh there was a time istole a couple computersfrom my office and my boss gave menegative feedback and i was really sadabout itit's a terrible answer right why was ita terrible answerthe sin is too significant it is toogreat so it should be somethingsmall um i always tell people whenyou're answering a question aboutsomething you did bad previouslycut your career in half make it from thefirst half you're eight years into yourcareermake it the first four years right putsome distance between yourself and theactionand then have a lesson right so this wasa thing i didyou know the way i reacted to it is iwanted to reallylearn from it i wanted to hear themunderstand itum and become better because of it andthen the the key to answering anyquestion about a prior mistakeis why it made you a better version ofyourself how did you insteadmoving forward alter your behavior tonever find yourself in the samesituation againso remember use the star methodsituation task action resultgive them an authentic thing that youdid and you received some feedback ofsomething you could have done a littlebit betterhow you received it in an emotionallyintelligentum you know adultuh way that is mature and then how youacted on it in a way to make sure thatit didn't happen again and you were abetter version of yourself that's thekeyif you do that you're going to answerthis question great the next question isa great oneand i'm going to give you an amazinganswer here because i think if youanswer this you're going to come off asa great candidateand it's talk about a time when you hadto help a difficult customerwho was impossible to satisfy what didyou doso i would make a point before i jumpedinto the star method i would sayyou know that's a really great greatquestion i'm passionate about helpingpeople and one of the reasonsis when you say difficult customeri think anybody who is difficult isactually just frustratedthey're having a difficult time and whenthat's the caseas someone who's in a customer serviceseat you have the abilityto help them and resolve that issue solet me give you a specific time and thengo into a specific time talk about how acustomer was having a really hard timetalk about how you listen to them youunderstood you took the time to hearthem outyou took their frustration you justdealt with it because you know okay thisisn't about methis is about the issue and then talkabout how you went above and beyondto solve it if it's just you know i didthis they were mad and then i did my joband then they were goodthat's not as powerful as talking abouthow you went above and beyondyou know you stayed a little bit lateyou followed up with them after to makesure their issue stayed resolvedbut make sure you do the situation theycame in the action you wereyou were responsible for solving thisissue for them umyou know that that's the task the actionhere's what you specifically did tosolve their issuekey you went above and beyond and theresult they were happythey they calmed down they weresatisfied with what you didum and then you know that's the resultthat you know you you turned afrustrated personinto a advocate for the brand and asatisfied customerand you did this with patience um andyou were understandingthe last thing i want to touch on ismindset rememberum you're you're a representativeof apple you're here to solve problemsyou are here toserve the customer you're approachableand you're enthusiastic aboutapple and what they offer the world ifyou dothese things you will absolutely nailyour interviewand you will probably get hired for thisjob and then you will help people likemewho are not technical at all and breakthings frequentlythere you go good luck in your nextinterview you got thisyou
