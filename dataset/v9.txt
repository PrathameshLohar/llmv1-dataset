want tohammer home how important it is to showthat you're a culture fit when you areinterviewing with apple let's just sayyou're a software engineer all thesoftware engineers who are alsointerviewing for that same role arereally good if you make it to theinterview round with apple you arequalified you have strong technicalskills you probably went to a greatschool you probably have a list ofaccomplishments that's everybody that'san even playing field so knowing thatyou have to look for opportunities todifferentiate yourself and to show thatyou're a better fit for apple and thebest place to do that is culture that'swhy this video is important now in thisvideo we're going to cover a few thingsi'm going to go over the company valuesso you know what they are but we're alsogoing to talk about three differentopportunities you're going to have toincorporate cultural information intoyour answers and into your questions soyou can show them that you were a greatcultural fit i'm going to cover thelayups the one where it's absolutelyeasy like yes this is a great spot toshow you're a culture fit i'm going tocoveradditional questions so questions wheremaybe it's not a no-brainer to includecultural information but the opportunityis absolutely there for you to insert itand then lastly i'm going to show youhow you can ask specific questions tothe person interviewing you that's alsogoing to indicate you are a greatcultural fit for apple we're going tocover all three of those thingsright now let's talk about the values ithink it's really important tounderstand this you can go to theirwebsite and do further research on itbut here are their company values it'saccessibility education environmentinclusion and diversity privacy racialequity and justice and supplierresponsibility knowing those is reallyimportant especially if your role issomewhere around that right like ifyou'reinterviewing for an hr role with applewell it's really important to know allof these but maybe also inclusion anddiversity because that's going to play areally important role in what you doin your function within the organizationor what if you are in procurement wellthen you have to understand thatsupplier responsibility is going to bekey because that is going to factor intoyour day-to-day every single day it isgoing to be a theme for you so knowingthese is really important but it'sespecially important to understand ifone of these values is directly incorrelation with the role you're goingto be performing with apple now let'stalk about the layup question the layupquestion is why apple i actually made anentire video on this question becauseit's a question you will be asked nomatter what the role if you wereinterviewing for apple retail if you'reinterviewing for a software engineerrole whatever it is you're doing withapple it is absolutely going to be aquestions you're going to be asked sowhy apple is a great opportunity to showthat you're a culture fit now wheneveryou get the question why and then thecompany name i have a specific rule itell people to use to make sure youcrush that interview question and it'sthe 50 50 rule50of your answer needs to be about theorganization why the organization isattractive to you and the other 50 ofthe answer needs to be about yourspecific role so remember that we'regoing to put that part in the parkinglot think about the role think about whythe role is good fit for you that's thesecond half but the first half of thisquestionshould absolutely be something about theculture this is a way for you to showthat you are a culture fit you are instrong cultural alignment so how do youdo that so the way you do that is easyyou pick one of these values and that'sthe first half so you could say you knowiam really interested in apple for a lotof reasons but when i was doing myresearch on your organization and ilooked at your cultural values i thoughti saw that you had education there i'msomeone who considers myself to be alifelong learner and continuing to learnand develop is incredibly important tome so working for a company where thatis a cultural value that is somethingyou hold near and dear to me that'samazing and it shows that i would be instrong cultural alignment with yourorganization which is great i don'tthink that's easy to find and i don'tthink you can find that with other youknow with every company so finding acompany where we have value alignmentthat is a key to me that's reallyimportant the second half is in thisrole i think i'd be great because blankand then you go on to talk about why therole is a really good fit for youbut from a cultural standpoint what idid was i used the first half of thisanswer to basically tell them i am acultural fit now you can include any ofthe ones you could talk aboutenvironment you could say you know oneof the things that's really important tome is understanding that while we allhave jobs to do we can do that and wecan also consider the well-being of theplanet so apple having environment asone of its you knowtop core valuesthat was really inspiring to me and it'sthe type of organization i want tobelong to or maybe you could pick out umracial equity and justice if that'simportant to you use that as thebeginning of your answer but wheneveryou were asked the question why apple donot waste that opportunity to show youare a great cultural fit now the secondhalf of this answer you got to talkabout why the role why is a role a greatfit for you but if you can doone pick one of their core values firsthalf pick the role second half you'regoing to crush this interview questionbut you're also going to show themheyben is a great cultural fit now the nextthing i want to do is i'm going to talkabout three questions that appledefinitely asks in their process sothese are confirmed i went out and foundthese online i confirmed them onmultiple sources so the following threequestions or questions you will be askedat apple they're also greatopportunities for you to talk about theculture a little bit so that's why i'mincluding them now the first question iswhat is something you have done in lifethat you are particularly proud of andwhy this is a great opportunity to talkabout education now if you figure outanother way to reference a value andincorporate it herethen absolutely do that but when theyask you this question you can saysomething along the lines of you knowone of the things that i'm really proudof is i'm a first generation collegegraduate um so being able to do that nothaving that example necessarily in frontof me but for me to be able to go outand do this and then also graduate witha 3.7 that is something i'm particularlyproud of i also noticed that educationis one of apple's core valueswhich was really inspiring to meeducation is so important so seeing thatapple has that as a valuei found that to be incredibly motivatingbut for mebeing a first generation graduate thatis something i am incredibly proud of itwas challenging but having done it wasreally important me what you did therewas you answered their question but youanswered itand reference one of their culturalvalues and then you also let them knowheythis is important to mewe have this in common it's important toapple and it's important to me greatopportunity to reference one of theirvalues the next question appleabsolutely asks in their interviewprocess is what frustrates you the mostwell this is a great opportunity toreference a variety of their values ifyou think about it all of their valuesare in strong chuck's position tosomething that's going wrong in theworld right supplier um you knowsupplier responsibility well that'sdifferent from companies who areirresponsibly sourcing goods ormaterials right so you could totallysay that right especially if you're inprocurement uh procurement excuse me umbut this is a great opportunity to speakabout the environment i reference thisin the y applebut you you knowif they say what frustrates you the mostyou know you could probably say you knowone of the things that really frustratesme todayis how business go aboutum you know trying to make a profitwhile completely ignoring theirenvironmental impact this is frustratingto me because it's an incredibly selfishdecisionit's one of those things where it'sgoing to impact people for generationsthe the damage they are doing to theenvironmentpurely based on profitability i findthat to be incredibly selfish anddemotivatingit's one of the reasons why i'minterviewing with apple and why i'vepursued apple as an end destination foremployment i know that environment isone of the things that apple holds dearit's one of your core values so for meit's a motivating factor for support youknow for um for going after thisopportunity or pursuing this opportunitythat right there another greatopportunity it's a question apple isabsolutely going to ask you and you canstick the landing by incorporating oneof their core values feel free to pickout one of the other ones if you canmake a good case as for why it'ssomething that frustrates you but ithink environment's a great opportunityhere now the next question appleabsolutely asks in your interviewprocess is what would you change aboutyourselfand i talked a little bit about this inmy prior video on how to land a job withapple but this would be a greatopportunity to reference inclusion anddiversity you know you could say one ofthe things that i would love to changeabout myselfum is being able to speak anotherlanguageinclusity and diversity um are thingsthat i think are really important ithink it's important in the work for inthe workplace but i understand that if iwas able to speak another language imight be able to be a more significantcontributor to inclusion and diversityin an organization i worked forbonus point if you have downloadeddulingo or babel and you are currentlylearning another language then you couldsayi'm actually working on this right nowso currently i've got a 100 day streakgoing with dulingo i am trying to learnspanish because i think if i could addthatum to my abilities if i could learn tospeak spanishthat would be really impactful so that'swhat i would change i would immediatelychange without about myself so by doingthat you talk a little bit aboutinclusion and diversity how you cancreate space for others in a workingenvironment and if you could speakspanish you could be a more activecontribute contributor to that to thatchange so that's a to me that's a reallygood way to answer this question but ifyou could figure out another way toincorporate one of the values andanswering this interview question ithink that would be a good key now thelast thing i want to talk aboutis you asking questions right up untilthis point you being able to show youwere a great culture fit is entirelydependent upon them asking you questionsbut it doesn't have to be that way youdon't have to wait for someone to saytell me about yourself or why apple atthe end of the interview they're goingto give you an opportunity to askquestions and this is a greatopportunity for you to fold in values sothe first one that i have here is youcould say something along the lines ofone of the things that i find to bereally important in a company issupplier responsibility so it was greatto see that as one of apple's valueshow have you been able to see this playout in your roleso that right there you're prefacing itbefore you ask the question you'reletting them know this is a value that'simportant to meand then you ask your question you coulddo this with basically any of the corevalues and it's kind of like an easy wayto do it it's like the training wheelsof incorporating a cultural value intoyour interview but i think it'simportant you could always say you knowracial equity and justice is reallyimportant to me what have you seen inyour time with applethat they did to directly contribute tosolving this issue in america that is aquestion you can ask and by doing thatyou not only ask a great interviewquestion but you show them that you arein strong value alignment all right sothe second question you can ask and thisagain is another way for you to kind ofpreface the question by demonstratingvalue alignment but it's education isvery important to me because because iconsider myself to be a lifelong learnerit was really great to see that listedas one of apple's values have you feltsupported in your time here to learn andgrow as a professionalthis is really good because one itstates initially right out of the gate iam a cultural fit one of your values isimportant to me but then it turns it onthemand it's a great way for you to bondwith them it's a great way for you tolearn about them and their goals when itcomes to education and if they have feltsupported again i think this is a reallygreat way to show you're a greatcultural fit the last one is easy andit's another one to get them talkingit's another way to build a relationshipbond but the secret to this one is inthe second half of the question so thefirst half is which of apple's valuesresonates most with youthis is open-ended and it allows them topick one that is near and dear to themyou listen to them you understand youhear them and then at the end of it nomatter what it was you can sayyou know what i love that answer that'sactually one of the values that reallyinspired me i don't think you see thatwith a lot of organizations but to seethat apple has blank as one of its corevalues was really inspiring because it'sactually super important to me i seethat we have that in common so that is agreat way to ask a question that'sopen-ended let them answer and reinforcealignment not only are you aligned withthe company now but you are aligned withthem specifically people want to hirepeople like them it's just kind of humannature this is a good way for you tomake that happenwell there you go those are a bunch ofdifferent ways that you could show applei'm a great culture fit at the end ofthe day apple is always going to havegreat applicants whenever you'reinterviewing with apple it is going tobe stiff competition but this isabsolutely a way you can give yourselfan advantage and land a job with applegood luck in your interviewyou got thisyou
