in this video i interview my good friendbryce who is an engineering projectmanager at apple it's a pretty longvideoso i put all of the topics that wetalked about in the description belowwith the timestampsso put this video on in the backgroundwhile you're studying orplaying cyberpunk but i think we cover alot of valuable pieces of advicelike applications general pmresponsibilitiesinterviews impostor syndromeday-to-day life at apple all goodthings like that you can find bryce'slinkedin in the description below alsoyou'll see a couple different cameraangles basically because i had to stitchtogetherthe audio of this separate microphonewith thevideo of my separate dslr alongsidethe recorded audio and videofrom our actual interviewer q a so youmight seemy dslr and then you might see somefootage of my webcam which is way worsequality buti think the video is still good stillvaluable has a lot ofgood tangible advice so i hope you guyslike it yeah dude i actually i've beenwatching a couple of these videos mani'm oh yeah somebody is finally talkingaboutproduct and project management yeahthere's not there's not a lot ofnot a lot of creators in that spacehonestly in the tech world soit's also it's a hard thing to learnaboutas a college kid i think right likei still don't even know what it issame honestly it changes every time i gointo work it's likeexactly um but yeah it'slike i remember when i was studyingthere was if you're in csthat's what you're in like you're goingto be a software engineer there's noexploration of oh what is a pm can i dothat right after college soso i know you uh but a lot of the peoplethat are going to watch this probablydon't and be creepy if they did but umso just briefly just give a little bitabout your college background likewhat did you major in and then what sortof internships did you haveyeah uh so my college background i guessis a littlebit of a collection of weirdhappenstance right so i studiedmanagement scienceuh minored in both computer science andbusiness and soyou know entering the project managementspace you can kind of see how thosecombine um i spent a lot of timeinvolvedin the cs department though so i was ata for the cs department forlike two years and and worked with thesame professor was helping designcoursework and assignments do all thatfun stuffmy internships and things like that werealso kind of a collection so i did twosoftware engineering internships atviasat uh which isyou know a company down in san diegotelecommunications company for folks atucsd they're they're hopefully familiarwith itum i did one in their commercial spaceand one in their government spaceand the following summer i went tomicrosoft and did a pm internship thereoh yeahyeah we got good things oh yeahum but yeah so my experience iskind of a weird collection of oh i wasin the economics department but workedwith the cs departmentum and you know i started the softwareengineering then ended up in projectmanagementgotcha so how did you sort of like iguessnavigate through all that did you likedo research or just likefound these opportunities or what reallylike caught your eye that made you wantto do some of these thingsyeah uh i guess you know i i said it wasa weird collection of happenstance and igot really lucky with a lot of myopportunities umfor my first couple software engineeringinternships i just happened to go to ajob fairand and meet some folks that were reallyfriendly at a viasat boothtalked him up and and you know the restis history ended up getting aninternship andfalling in love with that company umwent back there a couple summers soit was just luck show up at a job fairand so yeahwe're great you know um for microsoft itwas the samesame deal i was just hanging out withsome friends on a friday at a pizzaplace on campusreally there there happened to be amicrosoft recruiting event and so ii went up and i was wearing like afloral hawaiian shirt and short shortsand yo what's up dude oh you know what'swhat's going on i recognized some of thestudents that ii had tutored in and taught over thelast couple yearsstanding in line so it's like oh what'swhat's going on they're like oh it's amicrosoft recruiting eventand so i stand in line i end up talkingto someone just kind of chatting them upandit turns out that was the the ucsdrecruiter they're like you know whatwe know that you don't have a resume oranything like that on youum but yeah like come to on-siteinterviews and soi got lucky there you know with mytutoring jobs at ucsdsomebody at school basically told me heythis is probably what you want to doif you want to be in a tech space and soi applied and ibrought a professor out to lunch one dayand at the end of the day he emailed meand said hey i'd really like you to jointhe staff soit was a combination of really luckyevents umand so i i really just credited to otherpeople right somebody told meto be a tutor somebody told me to applyto microsoft like it wasoh yeah a lot of luck a lot of luck butyou still did those things so it's likeyou know swinging at the opportunitiesthat are there righti'll take i'll take minimal credit okaygotcha so for the management sciencewhat like actually is that i guess yeahthat's no that's actually a fairquestion it's kind of an unusualname for a major i guess um and i thinkwhat i would describe it as isa little bit like economics um butyou're taking engineering math coursesand you're getting a little moreinvolvedin the mathematical analysis of things ialso spent a lot of time focusing onbehavioral economics through managementsciencewhich is the study of why people makedecisions the way that they doum and and sort of the science behindthat the the science andthe math and so i it's kind of likeeconomics but a focusin you know management and andfiguring out why people do the thingsthey do so it was it was interesting butjust kind of a weird subsection ofeconomics for suregotcha and have you felt that that haslike helped you in the job ormost of what has helped you has beenlike experiencein the industry actually yeah i most ofthe things that help me in theday-to-dayare you know experience it's learninghow to work with people learning how tostay on topof of my tasks but i think managementscience gave me an interestingperspectiveum in that you know when i'm makingdecisions now i'm wondering why i'mmaking the thingsor why i'm choosing the things that i doand why other peopleyou know act and respond the way thatthey doand sort of keeping that in mind andthat additional perspective has helpedme a lotum but it's sort of like backgroundright likeanybody who has a different backgroundwill bring that into theirtheir work and i think for me it justhappens to bemanagement science and and forcing me tothink about why people choose the thingsthey dothat makes sense that makes sense and ifif you had the chance togo back to college would you changeanything or are you pretty happy withhow everything turned out yeah that's aninteresting question i think when i wasin college and i was studying managementscienceall that i wanted to do was say that iwas studying computer scienceyeah i'm like oh yeah i'm one of thosepeople it's like a flex major a littlebit yeahexactly if you're not in computerscience there was a certain level ofof competition right it was like therewere the ultimate cs people and thenthere were all the other majors um andso i thinkin college i would have said you know iwish i could start from day one againgo into cs but now a couple years out ithink i can actually look back at thatand say you know what ii did get kind of lucky you know i endedup in this major i met cool people ilearned interesting thingsum and i i don't think i would be atapple right now if it weren't forthe way that all of these things worktogether you know soi i wouldn't change it now but i thinkyeah a couple years agoyep i guess like people have asked methat and sometimes in the commentspeople say likeoh was it worth going to college was itworth majoring in computer science andit's always a tough question becausei can look back and say well yeah it'sworth because i work at microsoft now soit's definitely worth it but had thingsuhnot worked out maybe i would feeldifferently and iimagine that's the same with you so yeahand ido think you know to those comments aswell i thinkcollege is kind of getting a badreputation right now and you don't needit to become acomputer scientist yeah it does help alotright just in terms of who you meet andthe advice that you'll get from yourpeers and things butlike the the introduction to internshipsand and job fairsi think that goes a long way you cancertainly learn the technical stuffoutside of school um but thatthat nuance really helps a lot and ithink that sort of helps us get to wherewe areright yeah definitely soi get a lot of comments about you knowcollege student like current collegestudents from a variety of majors a lotof them computer sciencea lot of them data science a lot of thembusiness related um but all want to workin techin general so do you have anylike big piece of advice directedtowardsthose people or just any collection ofadvice anything that could help thosepeople outwhen they want to look forcareers in the tech space yeah uhi will say my biggest piece of advice isget as involved in the tech space aspossibleum you know it's it's easy even whenyou're in collegestudying computer science to buryyourself in course workand just focus on like getting straighta's and things like thatum but my advice is has always sort ofbeen you know get jobsum become a tutor you know help helpyour other classmatesget internships get the real worldexperiencebecause as much as you want to learnabout you know data structures andalgorithmsoperating systems invert a binary treeyeahexactly right you can do thoseimplementations all daybut when you get into the real worldyou're notyou know designing a hash table when yougo into work every day like maybethat'll be something you want to do fora project at some pointum but it's really you know learning towork with peopleand and being flexible in what you pickup what technologies you're learningand so it's just get get real worldexperience right if you're in collegegreat you can be a cs major or non-csmajorif you've got internships you can end upin the tech spaceright i think that's the key yeah idefinitely agree agree with thatso in terms of that like sort of as anextensionyou know when these current collegestudents right now when they're lookingat companiesyou know there's the you know the fangobsession the fang moolah exceptionwhatever the acronym is for thedifferent you know tech companiesstartups and things like thatum there's definitely an obsessionwhether that's oncs career questions or team blindwith with scoring roles at thosecompanies butwhat do you think people should look forin a companyyeah i i mean i also fell into that sameobsession right where it's like i needto end up atthe big five or fang or whatever it wasi i think i got caught up inmy own ego in saying you know i i wantto be able to tell my parents like wherei work have them know exactly what it isum and there there's some value to thatbut i think what'smore important is finding a team andfinding a managerthat you really get along with um inpast internships like i've fallen inlove with companiesbut the the thing that's stood out to memost is when a manager really caresabout you and your future and yourdevelopmentthat goes a lot further right you couldwork at any company in the worldyou know if you're comfortable and yourmanager wants to see you succeedyou're going to feel better in that roleday to day than if you ended up ata top five company with someone whodidn't care as much rightso i i will brag about my manager alldayum but she she really wants to seeme succeed she wants to talk about mygoals and where i want to end up if if iwant to end up at apple or if that'selsewhere she wants to help me um and soi think that'sthat's the biggest thing people shouldlook for it's not the name of a companyit'smake sure your manager and your teamcare about yougotcha yeah i mean i i definitely sharethe same sentiments butin the sense that what should someone doin case they don't have that yeah if ifyou wereif you ever find yourself in a positionwhere you're stuckand and you feel stuck and and you feellikeyour manager is not supporting you andand you don't really know what to doit's better to start looking for a newopportunity than to get stuckin that same role right if if you fastforward and you're you're miserable andthen two years lateryou're still miserable and you're in theexact same role and you were thinkingthat you would progress but you don'thaveyou know other people don't have yourbest interest at heart you're just gonnafeel more stuckright and and you want to find the thejob and the role that's right for youand especially for those people leavingcollegeyou kind of have the time to be flexibleyou don't you don't need to settle downright away findthe right job and then the rest willfigure it itself out rightmy college professor said that you knowwhile you're young take those risksbecause you this is the only time inyour life wheremost of the decisions you make don'thave massive repercussions rightyour tolerance for moving around willwill change right ifif you're somebody who wants to start afamily you're not going to be asenthusiastic aboutup and and changing your role you knowonce you've got a family or you've got ahome or whatever your goals areyou you want to do that in your 20sbecause it's the only time you're goingto want to do thatyeah definitely so you've had a lot ofexperiencein you know two very large companiesboth microsoft and applein that pm space so i guesshow has your experience been just inprogram management in generalum and then how have how has thatexperience varied from microsoft toapple yeahmy experience in general has been thatprogram project product managementare all very different things atdifferent companies right like microsoftand appleboth have entirely different ideas ofwhata pm is supposed to oh definitely yeahsothat's that's like the biggest thingthat i've learned isis you can go to a company thinking yourjob's going to be one thing and it mightturn out to be something totallydifferentat microsoft right it's very technicaland you're writing specs and you areyou you kind of own a feature it's ohyeah you're from from top to bottomyou're toldhey do this thing and it's on you tomeet with the technical writers and andmeet with these thesedifferent people meet with theengineering teams and get that featuredone you know start todude i literally code like five hours aday yeah yeahthat's a pm yeah you you couldyou know maybe you have to put togethera demo and there's no engineeringwork available you're like oh okay ican't do this myselfexactly and so that that happened atmicrosoft whereasyou know at apple your job as a pm is alittle bit more of a support functionthan anything you're less driving andmore helping engineering managers whoare very technical folksum complete whatever features they havein mind right they say hey we want toaccomplish thiswe're going to need somebody to helpkeep us on track and and help drivecross-functional work and and track allof thisum and that's sort of where the the pmsat apple come in soi i think that is the role that i haveliked a little bit more betweenapple and microsoft but for folksaspiring to bpms it'sespecially important that you find outwhat the role looks like at any givencompany because there's nothere's no safe bet or safe conclusionyou'll come to as to what you'll bedoingyeah i definitely for people listeningthat want to to go into pm it'sit's very much unlike softwareengineering where as a software engineeryou can expect thatyou're going to be writing code i meanthat's what they do umbut as a as a pm at least uh from myexperienceat microsoft it's been more of acatch-all in whereeven a pm you know i'm i'm in azure so apm in azureacts much differently than a pm inoffice or something like thatuh and it really depends on what yourteam needs so we already briefly talkedaboutyou know advice that you had for currentcollege students but let's say there'syou knowsomeone maybe that's not a new gradmaybe they've already been in someother non-related industry um or maybethey're in some other engineering likemechanical or something like that butthey really want to make the transitionto uh the pm space specificallyin a tech company so do you have anyadvice for those peopleum you know that aren't current collegestudents or would you say it's you knowthe same advicebeing you know really invested in thetech space in generalyeah i i think the advice actually willwill shiftjust a little bit right um i i'm in ateam that isreally a strange collection ofbackgrounds right we havepeople who who worked at applecare foryears somebody whoyou know worked as a business admin andmade the transition to pm someone whoworked in salesand those folks are some of the best pmsthati have ever met um and they don't havethethe traditional you know techbackgrounds theyhave worked at apple for a long timethey were familiar with the products butentering the operating system pm spacelike that's notsomething where you're going to have alot of experience that transfers overright and so they they entered it and ithinkwhat helped them succeed and and doreally well at what they're doing um isone sort of a love for product uh youknow most of them had worked at apple indifferent roles for a long time theylovedthe company uh so they were interestedwhen they started inoperating systems to learn everythingthey couldum even if you're non-technical you knowdigginginto code and taking classes and doingthings like that on the sidehelps a long way but i think there arealso skills that are pretty universal topmsthat they had and and continue todevelop you knowthose include communication skills andand organizational skillsum and those those went a long way sothey startedin a technical role with non-technicalbackgrounds and it was because thoseuniversal skills could help carry themas far as they did right so for folks innon-technical roles who want tojump into a technical pm role i thinkcompanies are learning you know youdon't alwaysneed to have a super technicalbackground to become a great pmum at apple itself right they used toexpect people had a cs degree ortechnical degreeand and now they're starting to realizelike oh people with with variedbackgrounds andtypes of experience can make great pmsand they'll they'll hire and you knowthey'rethey're all the better for it um so it'sjustas long as you love technology love theproductyou can be a really good pm by justdeveloping thosethose additional skills that that aresort of universalgotcha gotcha so among those skillswould you say there's onespecifically for pms that is like vitalwhere it's like all the all pms sharethis specific skilland and and why yeahit might sound a little cliche but iwould i'd call it people skillsum and that's sort of a broad categoryof things righthaving people skills is you know havinggreat communication skills you canclearly articulate your ideas you canask the right questionsyou can know when to sort of poke andprod at an ideawhen breakout sessions are gonna need tooccur right you justyou have that people sense and you knoweven if you don't understand everythingtechnically that's going on indiscussion you can say oh you know thereseem to beor there seems to be a little confusionaround xyz topic and you can justinherently catch that um and soi think just having that ability in theinnate people skills goes goes a longway um and i'd say that's that's thenumber one there are obviouslybetter skills that are helpful yeahbeing able to read people and talk topeople is is the biggest thing i thinkyeah and i think that that rings trueforfor a lot of you know positions um maybeless so on the software engineering sideumobviously you won't be be meeting withcustomers usuallyon that side but um i think havinghaving people skillsin any company is a solid uh becauseyeah definitely definitely umso speaking with your experience rightnow at applewhat do you do day to day is there likea routine that you go throughum is every day different uh things thatyou can't tell usjust you know kind of run through the uhi i think what most pmswould say to this answer is no day everlooksthe same there are times when i'll i'llwalk into work thinking that i'm gonnahave to accomplish some set of tasks andtheneverything is blown off the rails bylike like whoaokay you know i guess i'm figuring thatout now umbut in general right it's like wake upcheck the crazy amount of like emailsand slacks that you missed while youwere sleepingum deal with those sort of make sureyou've got your agendas set for themeetings you've got during the dayand and sort of your goals for the weekum i'ma big fan of white boarding so i've gotlike oh yeahover there here are the things you needto accomplish today likenext week all color coded and thingslike that umbut every day kind of looks differentright in generaluh it's it's a lot of organizingmeetingsand sitting the right folks down knowingwho needs to talk about what issues toget you unblockedum but sort of there's a lot ofopen-endednessin in project management where you'rejust gonna have toyou're faced with new problems every dayand you're just gonna have to figure outhow to deal with those right your job isnotconsistent it's not like oh i'm going tofix you know this bug today it'shey we've got some meta problem that nowwe need tochange our design and what do we do nextand it's your job to figure that outyeah i that's definitely uh althoughyou know pms in at apple and atmicrosoft have uh slightly differentresponsibilities at microsoft i've evennoticed thatthe same thing and and some of my videosi basically say that you knowpm whatever role it may be at whatevercompany you'reyou're essentially making sure thatwhatever you're working on is goingsmoothly sowhatever that means you know goingsmoothly so it's likeif you don't have enough developers wellit's like strap on the coding bootsright because that needs to go smoothlyrightyou've had a a couple differentexperiences um atviasat at microsoft at apple umand and burnout in the in the tech spaceis you know very big especially forpeople coming right out of college theytypically you know hit the groundsprintingand then die really quickly so have youever feltburnout and if you have what did thatfeel like i guessand what caused that and do you have anytips for people thatare experiencing that or are afraid ofexperiencing thatyeah i uh i mean i thinkyou said it right when college studentsreallyexit the gate and are just going fullspeed likeyou know i'm i'm 20 something years oldi'm ready to spend20 hours like every day exactlyi'm going to skip sleep and that kind ofstuff like i i think my firstexperiences with burnout were in collegeand i don't think that's unusual for alot of people umucsd really pushed its students hard andsolike working jobs and trying to maintainany kind of academic standing is reallytoughum and so i kind of finished college andi was like oh okay like that was rough istumbled through my last year umand then i i took a few months offbefore i started workand i think just recently i finally hitthat point where it's like i've passedmy one yearmark and i'm already like oh my godi'm exhausted like i i went through thiswholeyear at work i wanted to prove myselfyou know i was spending 10 to 12 hours aday at workand you get to a point where you'rewaking upand you you're exhausted like it doesn'tmatter if you sleep10 hours or whatever you're keeping yourdiet you're working out like you'restill justtired all the time it could just be likemental exhaustion just like the constantyeah waking up and you're like oh godokay i see all the things i need to dobut i feel like i don't have energyand so you can become a little lethargicwhenwhen you're burnt out you just you'relike okay i guess i'll check my emailand okay i guess i'll likego to this meeting and take notes andit's it's tough and i i experienced thatum the only thing that really helped wasyou know talking to my manager about itand being honest with her and sayingyou know hey i'm having a rough timelike i'vereally tried my best to like do a lotapple isvery competitive in these big techcompanies right they push you reallyhardum and so talking to her she's like yeahyou know what youyou have been kicking ass the last yearlike you should take a breatheryou know take a week off don't look atyour computer we'll cover youum and so that helped me a lot when itwasoh you know what like i i don't need toburn myself outto feel like i'm doing good at my jobyou know and i think that's whata lot of people do you know withimposter syndrome as present as it isi think people cope by saying i'm goingto work crazy hours and do a ton so thatto prove myself in that sense yeahexactly you'repeople need to know how good i am andthe only way to do that is by workingall the timeum and i don't think that's i don'tthink that's needed rightyou stop and reflect and you're like ohyeah you know what my manager does thinki'm doing a good job and maybe i canbreathe and maybe i can give someresponsibilities to other people whowant to learn new things or things likethat right yeah i've found thatmy manager on microsoft is also alsoreally awesome uhvery open and i think most peoplewill hopefully have good managers youknow hopefully they're a manager for areason andand they're and they're actually good umbut yeah i've i've only been working foryou know five or six monthsum but i've definitely experienced iwouldn't say a longperiod of burnout but i would say maybelike a day where i'm like damn i'm justexhausted and in those senses uh maybethat day i workuh you know i i code a little bit lessor i'veuh i've taken like a mental health dayoff which i'vehas revitalized me a lot if you havethose opportunities while workingdefinitely take advantage of it andmost managers almost encourage thatbecauseyou might as well take take a mentalhealth daycome back you know really refreshed andthen you can really hit the groundrunning again rather than just draggingyour feetand not taking a day off you know i i dothink there'syou know the meta problem with ourgeneration where we entered it's like wewant to workall the time because we're told that'swhat you have to do and yeahyeah stopping and realizing you're doinga good job and kind of appreciatingyourselfand taking mental health days andactually using your vacationexactly it goes a long way people in theusyou know work a lot and we're kind ofknown for it and you work with peoplefromyou know europe and they're like why whydon't you take it yeah exactlyyeah it's yeah take a breather you knowwork is work but you also have to takecare ofyourself as a person exactly and i thinka lot of the the big tech companies nowsome areare are more known to be more rigorousthan otherssome have better work life balances buti think a lot of themshare the sentiment that uh you knowthey want to treat their employees wellhence the the good compensation hencethe good packages and stuff like thatbecause uh you know a well-restedemployeewill do better than one who's justconstantly burnt out because they'retrying to perform and they can lastlonger soyou know and you transitioned actuallynicely into my next question which isabout imposter syndrome sohave you experienced imposter syndromeum andif you have how did you do you stillexperience that how did youtake steps to sort of remedy thatanything like that or advice to peoplewhoare scared of having that or currentlyhave thatyeah i i think i i certainly haveexperienced imposter surgery i i i stilldo from time to timeum and i think only now atyou know 24 years old am i finallyrealizing how to stop and and take alookat what i'm doing um andi'll start by saying like for folksexperiencing imposter syndrome you'renot aloneright like i i think most people do eventhe mostconfident in your classes or the mostconfident of your colleagues will havetimes where they thinkwhy am i doing the things that i'm doinglike i'm not even good at this should ichange everythingum and so those aren't unusual thoughtsright and sometimes it helpsyou feel better when you realizeeverybody else is kind of thinking thesame thing nobody will talk about itwhich i think makes things hardbut folks feel it um and so i thinkfor people like you and for myself whoare at big companiessomebody else might look at that and andsay that is the measure of success likethey made it how can they experienceimposter syndrome like when iworked at microsoft i got to ask satya aquestionhow nice about imposters hey have youexperienced thisand even he was like yeah you know whatit's a thingeverybody does um andlike that that is the ceo of theworld he's like yeah that's that's aperfectly natural way to feelum and so i think imposter syndromestems fromtrying to push yourself trying to youknow feel like you're doing a good joband i think if the only metrics of youdoing a good job or like your ownself-approval that's going to be reallyhard toever close on right because we as peoplewill continue to try and do biggerbetter thingsyou're never gonna feel like you'redoing enough or that you are enoughum and so what what's worked for me ishaving conversations with with peers andmanagers like hey creating an avenue foropen feedback goes a long way like thethe partners the engineering managers iwork withsaying hey am i helping you what can ido better this weekyou know having like weekly one-on-onesand saying looki've got time in my schedule or i don'tand and setting expectationsso that you can tell very tangiblyam i doing things that that are asked ofmeyes or no and if the answer is no thenyeah maybe you want to reevaluatehow you're going about tasks maybeyou'll realize you're too busy andthat's why things are falling off yourplate maybe you'll realize you're burntoutwhatever it is giving yourself tangiblegoalsand and measuring yourself against thatrather than justgetting stuck in this you know mindsetof am i doing enough am i doing enougham i doing enoughthat helps a lot so it's set your goalsstick to them if you're not meeting themevaluate whyi think that's the only thing that canhelp you with imposter syndrome is thatlittle bit ofyou can't get stuck in your own head ifyou've got actual benchmarks toget exactly yeah if you can't measure ityou can't manage it rightyeah exactly exactly exactly the projectmanager yeahexactly uh exactly and i i think it'simportant to note that imposter syndromecould comein in you know many different forms soit might hit one person one way and itmight hit another person another wayso you could be you know reallyconfident in your say coding abilityum but not be confident in say yourpresentationability or something like that um i knowfor me personallyuh the areas in which i felt impostersyndrome werewere less than the sense of presentationbut it was more of uhwas i asking too many questions i guessumand i because i'd always be asking othersoftware engineers when i was coding i'mlikeoh how do you do this in in c sharp orlike where's this in the code base and ii always felt like i was asking too manyquestions uh so i'd always say like ohsorry for so many questionsor sorry to bother you again and i wouldalwayspreface my question with a sorry becausei didn't want to bother them buti would say 99.9 of the time i'm notbothering them and they actuallyencouragequestions so that's that's peoplegetting stuck in their own headright yeah if you if you make it onebroad point it'syou know you feel like you're not doinga good enough job at engineering butthe code base at microsoft like ismassive oh yeah yeah and i'll bet a lotof the engineers that you're askingquestionswish that they had been comfortableenough to ask the same questionsbecause we've all been there where youknow you work on something you don'twant to ask a questionand then you spend like six hours tryingto dig through something that youcould have gotten in 10 minutes yeahexactlyand it just you dig yourself deeper soit's better to have an open environmentfor feedback for questionsagain we're in the same boat we all havethings we're worried aboutum it feeds into imposter syndrome weall feel it differently butan open environment helps a lot more ohdefinitely100 um so going backto um your college or internshipsinternship experiences a little bit wasthere a certainuh skill that you learned in college orin an internship or a specific eventthat made you have some sort of epiphanyor was it more of likean accumulation of this experience thathas helped you where you are right nowi i think i think it was more of anaccumulation of things right it washappening to meet the right people atthe right time it wasyou know somebody sort of picking meunder their wing and saying heyyou need to go become a tutor um or orgiving me that guidance openly that ledme to where i was i don't thinkthere was a moment where i like wentinto an internship one day and was likei'm gonna be an epm like that'sthis is my future um because that's alsothat's a nerve-wracking thing i think toto stop and say i know exactly what iwant to do with myselflike that would be a lot and so i thinkit was more you know ipm was interesting to me and i went tomy internships and i worked with pms andi was like you know thatthat's pretty cool like they're they'retechnical people they get to usecommunication skillsthat seems like something i want to doumand then just kind of keeping that inthe back of my mind and helping guide metooh maybe i can give a lecture and workon my communication skills maybe i canuh join a club or maybe i can you knowjoin there's so many spaces onlike facebook and things like that forpms now so maybe i'll join one of themand see what people say about it so idon't think there was a singleepiphany moment it was more of you knowover time i learned ohpm that's that's a pretty cool job itseems like let'slet's keep it in the back of my mind ifjobs open up if ifyou know if i happen to walk into aplace to grab pizza and find amicroscopethen i'll do that right um but it's yeahit was all justeverything seemed to add up and then iwas like oh yeah pmpm i think is the right thing for megotcha and you mentioned thisjust briefly you said like oh someonetaking you under their wings sodo you recommend for people uh whetherthat'sin college they look for like a mentorwhether that's a college professor inupperclassmenuh or if someone's a new grad theyjoined a new companyuh a lot of a lot of tech companies havementorship programshow have you had your or how has yourexperience withmentorships whether you were the mentoror whetheruh you were the mentee do you recommendthat and how was your experience in thati i don't have too much experience as amentori think um and i think that feeds intothe imposter syndrome like how am isupposed to give somebody else advicewhen i feel like i need advice as wellexactly yeahum so i don't know how much experience ihave thereother than you know in college i hadguys come up to me and ask me questionslike heyhey man i see that you're interested inpm what do i door or folks asking i have asked youthose questionsand so it's not like a formal mentorshipbut it's yeah i like being able to sayi ended up in this pretty unique spaceand and you know wasfortunate to land the position that ihave nowum so i can give some advice um and ii think that helps the folks a lotright because it helps them figure outwhat they want out of out of work out ofschool out of all these things if you'rejusta person who can answer questions ithink that's a good place to startum and you'll you'll get experiencebeingkind of a mentor that way and feelcomfortable helping other peoplewhich i think is useful experience but ii do think it's critical that everybodyfindsa mentor um for me it's it'smy manager and a few of the other youknow my managers peersat apple who i can just go to and askquestions you know like what got you tothe position that you're in howhow did you kind of climb the ladder atapple what did you do who did you meetwhy what do you think you did right whatdo you think you did wrong learning fromtheir successes and their failures isexperience that helps a lot right you'renot living the failures or successes soobviously there's something lost intranslation therebut it does help you reevaluate whereyou areand how you might you know traverse thecorporate world to get to where you wantto beum and my manager has told me the samething you know she gets mentored bysome of the heads of coreos at apple andandshe is always asking them for advice andand that i think is pretty consistent aconsistent suggestion ofget somebody who you admire and feelcomfortable asking themquestions because you admire them for areason andif you want to emulate parts of them theonly way you're going to do that is bytalking to them andlearning about them in their backgroundyeah i definitelyshare the same sentiments mentorshipsmentorships are are very valuable butuh sometimes a little bit daunting to toseek out buti think at a lot of at a lot of techcompanies and in college there's a lotof opportunitiesin a lot of different spaces to you knowget a lot ofgood life lessons from people a lotolder than you and don't stop atone either right like you have a mentorit'smaybe you have a professor and maybe youalso have like some of the other moresenior tutors if you're inin college or when you start workingmaybe havea peer of yours who's a little olderthan you and has been working for awhile have them mentor youget your manager get some other randompeople throughout the company likejust get them from all over the place soyou can pick and chooseyou know what you learn what adviceyou're getting what you want to apply toyour day-to-dayum give yourself that that breadth ofinformationexactly yeah that that breadth ofexperience and having sort of like aa large catalog of things to uh to gothrough when you when you encounter aproblem isis definitely helpful i think right nowspecificallyand just in general for current studentsor new grads it's particularlychallengingto to stand out to recruitersapplicationsfor those people do you have advicewhether that'syou know more broad advice where it'slike you knownetwork or is there more you knowtangible advice where it's likeput this on your resume don't submit i iknow i've talked touh some of our mutual friends wherethey're like don't submit resumes onlineuh um do you have any do you share anysentiments like thatpeople have very strong takes aboutsubmitting resumes online yeah umand you know i think it's it's fine tosubmit resumes onlinei don't think that in a lot of scenariosas a college kid that's gonna get youhiredright like unless you have someabsolutelyunreasonably impressivelike it's it's not going to help um ithink the reason thatyou know there are recruiting events andthere's an entirepipeline dedicated to meeting studentsin person you knowafter after covet those things will pickback up againum and the only reason there are thosethings is so thatrecruiters can use their people sensewhich they havedeveloped over years of professionalexperience to meet students and and talkto themand you know try and gauge them inpersonas well as look at their resume um andsoin terms of tangible advice your resumeis importantbut in reality your recruiter is onlylooking at that for likea couple seconds when you're talking tothem and soyeah you want to make sure that it's youknow formatted welli've seen a lot of you know collegecomputer science resumes they're justblocks and and blocks and walls of textum and i've seen other ones that kind ofstand out they're a little unique likelittle things like that you if you wantto stand out in a crowdstand out in a crowd don't have theexact same thing as everybody elseif you're going to a job fair yes youwant to be dressed niceyou want to have your resume printed youknow i i had mine laminated in collegelike weird and that's that's kind oflame it's like bring them in a folderyeah do the lame stuff likeprint it on cardstock that resonatesstick out in a pileit's gonna feel nice that fake favoriteexactly littlelittle things like that go a long wayand so they're they're kind of like dumbto think about you're like why would ineed to do that nobody else does thatbutif you're trying to stand out at a jobfair you need to think about standingoutso dress nice you know bring your bringyour peoplelike skills and and talk to therecruiter ask them about howthe recruiting event is going don't justpitch yourself askthey're real people so chat them up andand that's something thatthey don't get often and so that thatmakes you stand out as well asoh yeah i can i can just talk to themlike they're a real personyeah you know they want to hire me iwant to get hired by themyou know be friendly recruitingshouldn't be likea terrifying thing where you're talkingto a robot if that was the caselike everybody would just apply onlinethere would be no job fairs you'retalking to a person you know be friendlyto them andtreat them like you would another personnot like they'resome giant group holding like a job overyour head that you're trying to jump atright it'syeah talk to him and ask about thecompany do youdo you want to work there you know itmight be might be a big five company orsomething like thatthat maybe you're talking to a recruiterand it doesn't sound exactly right foryouum so yeah i don't know i'm sorry i wentoff on the ramble nono it's i i completely agree if you wantto stand out stand outright yeah that's that's the biggestadvice isdon't be every other applicant who justshows up with a piece of paperand you know answers some questions andthen leavesyeah exactly and and for for peoplewondering orthe people that i see on like cs careerquestions on reddit they're submittinglike thousands of applications onlineand uh i i have done the same thing andi can tell you right nownone of the applications i submittedonline without likeany prior recruiter contact ever turnedout to anythingmy northrop grumman internship i metthem at a career fairuh and that's how i got that internshipand thenuh the microsoft uh now that i'm workingat microsoft they actually reached outto me on linkedinand told me to apply so yeah man likethat's yeahthat's how it works i mean sometimespeople get lucky and they just you knowapply online and they get it which iswhich is great but for the vast majorityof people that's unfortunately notas easy so what are your thoughts onlinkedin do youthink it's a a good platform i'm notjust saying that because it'syou know owned by microsoft i i do thinklinkedin does a lot of things right umand it's sort of interesting to thinkabout howrecruiting is going to change right it'sone of those things where you have thisbroad idea of recruiting being oh you goto a job fair or you submit a resumeonline and like what happens happensum but i think linkedin what it doeswell is it takes advantage of like thesocial media ageof recruiting some people aresuper active on linkedin and they theypost all the time and that'sthey create content and that's that'snotnecessarily what i do i am one of thetype that just keeps mineup to date and you know check if i'mappearing in searches anddoing that kind of thing um but i ithinkeverybody should have a linkedin youknow thethe level at which you engage withlinkedin can vary butat the very least it's a tool to helpyou remember all of your experiencebecause if you know five years into ajob you're looking backand and trying to put together anotherresume if you haven't kind of beentracking that through somethingit'll make it hard like oh god whatexperiencesdid i have like you know spend timereflecting on all those fulljobs that you had you know five yearsago umand linkedin you know it's always thereyou can get new likecourseworks and badges and things ohyeahthere's not there's not a lot of effortneeded to make your linkedinlook really good right you just you fillin some job infoand and some titles and then you'llstart appearing in searches right andlike forvery little effort you can get a lot outof itum and so i think yeah everybody shoulduse it everybody shouldkeep keep track of their roles likerecruiters use that activelyum you can turn yourself you know youcan turn your preference for likeavailable or not and you'll seerecruiting messages if you show you'reavailable forfor work and so that's like the easiestthing you can do for yourself you'regonna start showing up in searchesrecruiters can set up bots that willlike look for certain experiences andstuff pretty activelyum and send messages so like it itdoesn't take a lot of time anybody who'sagainst linkedini have a hard time why it's likeyeah why not just create an account yeahexactlyit's it's fine it's gonna help youthere's there's not a downside to itum so yeah for folks in college or aftercollege use it it'sit's great um it's also it's a pretty uisoyeah they just they just updated the uhyeah yeah things look niceyeah uh i'm i'm a a proponent of uhnot you don't necessarily have to beactive on on linkedin iyou don't have to really post that muchbut keeping making sure it's up to dateit's like you mentioned one of the justthe easy things andyou know even if you don't have thatmuch experience it's just like anotherthinglike to just have there and just uhbecause you never know what a recruitermight stand out or they'll be like oh wewent to the same school or whateverso it's always you know just a an extralittle bonus thing to keep you knowyeah i there also is like the littleadded bit ofi like to see you know what oldacquaintances are are doing likewho just got a new job who just got itit's the social media aspect of theprofessional networkingyou can you can feel good about yourconnections like oh like you knowmichael juststarted microsoft like that's awesomeman exactlylike these promotion notifications likeyes like he'syeah he's making it um so there's thatlittle like you feel good for people tooyeah in a pandemic you're seeing peoplegetting new jobs and likeand celebrating these accomplishmentsand it feels good yeah i would say outofall the social medias now linkedin isnot like a typical social mediabut i i feel like i i like linkedin themost i don't spend the most time onlinkedin butit makes me feel the best compared tolike othersocial medias because it's just it'sfocused on you know your friendssuccessesand and new jobs and things like thatand like good stories soyeah i always like good content yeahexactly happy for peoplemore wholesome yeah yeah than say liketwitter or something like thatbut going along with sort of the resumelinkedin stuffso for for software engineers it's orcomputer science students that arelooking to become software engineersit'sa little bit easier when you don't havemore experience because you can alwayswork on side projects and things likethat to boost sort of your resume butfor people looking to specificallybecome a pmwhere you know side projects aren't asprominentor maybe it's a little bit harder whereyou can't just you know oryou can do this but it's less uhtargeted to pmyou know you can't just code up a youknow a chess game or something like thatand like here's my here'shere's my pm experience um so for thosesort of uh for those people that want toboost theirpm resume how how do you suggest they dothat yeah that'sthat's a tough question and i'm not surei have a great answer yet i don't thinkyou know like you said project manager'ssorry is aboutworking with other people and andbuilding new things and being excitedabout those and there's not reallya way to do that as a side project rightlike a normal software engineer you cango off aloneand work for you know several weeks andbuild something really coolyou can work with a couple othersoftware engineers but there's not yourteam's not big enough that you like needa pm most of the timeyeah or like a side project umand so what i did and and you know thepeople watching this can take thisas they will i had like weirdjobs that showed that i was good atcertain parts of you know projectmanagement where iyou know i was a tutor for the csdepartment i could show that i couldwork with students i could explaintechnical conceptsi could work with a large staff like asa head tutori was sort of leading a class and therewere like 50 tutors on the staff and soi was giving guidance to50 people um i worked as a tour guidefor ucsd for yearsoh yeah i remember that yeah exactly andso it's like yeahi can show i've got people skills that ican walk and talk backwards which is ayeah tell me when i'm going to hitsomething yes exactly the same jokesbut it was you know there's no singleside project you can do that looks goodbut i think what does look good isexplain your experiences and how theybenefityou as a pm right if you're a tour guideif you just say oh i was a tour guidethat's that's not going a long way butif you say like yeahi gave tours like several times a weekto groups of 30 peoplei was working on my communication skillsall the time i was having tomemorize a ton of information about ucsdin theoff chance somebody asks a very specificor targeted questionlike those are useful pm skills and andyou're not a pm as a tour guideobviously butthere are skills that that overlap andbeing atutor or ta you say oh i have theseskills and i developed themthis is how they overlap with what ithink a pm isyou know i worked in cs those skillsaren't all that you're going to need tobea pm but the technical skills helpoverlapand so there's no like prescriptionguidance of hey what can you dooutside of school tobe a pm or make your resume look goodit's you kind of have to see what'savailable to you whatopportunities see how you might be ableto pitch that to a recruiter if they askyou about themum and and go from there right it mighthave to be a collection ofseemingly random things where you'retaking a little bit from this a littlebit from that now it'scombined these skills would make me agreat pm yeah for pm it's very much howyou spin it and as sort of an extensionon thatfor people that want to be a pm in atech companywould you say there's a specific majorwhere it's like do thisyou'll be a pm very much where it's likecomputer scienceyou'll likely be a software engineerthat's like there's other paths tobecoming a software engineer there'sother majors you can dobut typically majoring in computerscience is the most direct route so doyou think there's a direct route forfor pm um i unfortunately again foreverybody watching i don't think thereisum that also might be fortunate you knowto the people whoaren't able to study cs because it'simpacted or something wherever they'rethey're going to school um you can kindofstudy whatever right like i technicallystudiedecon for the majority of my college iended up as a pm you know ione of my co-workers studied history incollegeoh that's it you're just thinking yeahshe's a kick-ass pianoum like she's really good at what shedoes andsomebody would normally look at that andbe like oh it's a history major like howdoeshow does that matter um and so i don'tthink there'sa prescription or some exact major orsomething that you cando that's going to say oh yeah you'regoing to be a pm you just i think it'syour experience rightyou study something and study thatsomething that you likebut other than that you know get yourjobs andand work on you know the collection ofrandommiscellaneous side things that wouldmake you a pmum like there's there's no major rightyou i'm sureyou as well have met pms who were formercs majors former econ former businessformeroh yeah all all total differentbackgrounds yeah yeah soyour background matters a bit in termsof education butpm has a lot of you know soft skillsthat you need to just have developedum and i don't think you're gonna learnmany of those soft skills in classesuh i know at some schools what what ispretty interesting is there's like asoftware engineering majorwhere it's a combination of likecomputer science and business and maybeif there wasa prescription something like that wouldbe the caseum you know i studied economics computerscience businessand that collection of things seemedalong the lines of what a pm might dobuti don't think there's clear guidancethere it's just yeah in a major you likeand if you really want to be a pm justspend time every day figuring out whatyou can do to make your resume look likeyou want to be a pmyeah and it definitely ties back to thethe how you spin it thing solike you said like history depends onhow you spin that majorand there you go you become a pmdirectly from that it's it's all overthe placeyeah but like you can you can dowhatever pms just need to show that theycare a lot about the technology they'reworking on and they can work well withother peopleexactly and then sort of this lasttwo porter question here is uh forpm interviews i always struggle withgiving advice for peoplelike interviewing for a pm rolemyself i interviewed as a softwareengineer soat microsoft uh i was offered a softwareengineering roleand then my current manager basicallyreached out and like hey i read yourinterview packet do you want to be a pmso i never really had a typical pminterview so i always struggle whenpeople ask mehey how do i like i want to be a pm howdo i prepare for that what do theysort of ask in those questions now youdon't have to give specific questions onwhat they ask youum but how do you recommend peopleprepare for that oh boyunfortunately i think i'm probably alsogoing to give terrible advicewhen i when i graduated i sent outseveral applications you know toto both pm opportunities and softwareengineering opportunitiesand there is a very clear contrastin like how those interviews goum software engineering interviews youknow if you're reading leak code andlike cracking the coding interviewand preparing all that kind of stufflike you can do wellyeah it's very much like studying for atest almostyeah exactly and that's that's probablyfair i know those interviews get a lotof flack but likeit's showing that you can prepare wellum and and you can you know youunderstand technical concepts i know alot of software engineering is alsogoogling things and that never getstested but likecopy paste stack overflow yeah yeahexactly and in general though it's likethosethey follow a pretty similar formatwhereas hey you're given a questionwrite out a solution talk us through itand go that wayum pm interviews uh like ii've been on both sides of pm interviewsnow where i'minterviewing candidates and i wasinterviewed myselfand it really depends on the interviewlike i don't think there's a clear wayto prepum i hope that in five yearsthis advice will be very outdated andsomebody will have like finally crackeditbeing able to give good advice um but ithink the point of being a pmis showing that you can think on yourfeet and andanswer any kind of question that mightget thrown outat you and i don't think that'ssomething that you can reallyprepare for like before an interviewlike you can'tstudy how to answer questions quickly orhow todeal with these weird scenarios rightyou just kind of have to have practicethat in your day-to-day lifeum and so i had bought like cracking thepm interviewyeah and i i do not think i opened itum for my apple interviews i was just iwas like you know what i'm going to gointo it i'm going tohave my cup of coffee i'm going to makesure i'm in like a good andcollaborative mood like i want tobe giving my age yeah you you turn it onand then you go into the interview yeahyou doi'm glad that's not just me but it'slike sometimes you just have to turn onlike the peoplesometimes i yeah exactly sometimes ijust gotta be all right it's time forinterview michaeltime to go on yeah yeah it's like gottashift into maximum overdriveyeah um but yeah i do thinkthere's no clear way to prep for themit's just you you have to flip theswitchand hope that everything you've beendoing in all your jobsproves that you are gonna be a good pmand i've definitelyfelt that uh you know interviews becomeeasier as you get more experiencespecifically in pm because you encounterall of these sort of situations thatthey may askask about and you can be like oh youknow at microsoftapple we we went through this process soit becomes easier as you get more intothe industry witha little bit more more years ofexperience you know you've gotexperience you can draw from you alsoyou know there is some value in the moreyou interviewyou know the the less nerves you'regonna have when you go into ityeah you've you've already gone throughthe process a bunch of times you knowwhatto expect yeah exactly so it'spm interviews are weird but there's noway to prep form it's justand on the switch yeah exactly questionslike theems are very good at throwing you offwhen they want to know somethingum and so you know if you're gettinginterviewed by good pmsthere's nothing you're going to be ableto that willanswer all their questions exactly it'sabout much more about being fluid andyeah like you saidthinking on your feet so just lastly arethere any resources that you recommendso whether books that you've readrecentlyuh websites you use consistentlyanything like that that you'd recommendto peoplejust tech industry in general whetherthat's software engineering pmanything like that yeah i uh i thinkthat when i was in collegei was looking for like any kind of pmgroup that i could any collection ofpeople that were interested in projectmanagementum and like at ucsd there were a coupleorgs that igot involved with you know they startedcoming out sort ofat the tail end of my college experienceso i you know there wasn't a big boomfor people getting hired as pm's i thinkout of college and i think we'reon the crux of that right you and italked a little bit about hownow we're we're talking about pms therearen't a lot of resources and that's whyyou have this channelum and so i think people just need tofindif there are any resources or groups ofaspiring pms that they can talk to rightit'ssurround yourself with people interestedin it if you know pms alreadytalk to them as often as you can likelinkedin stock a couple people if you'reif you're familiar likesome of the linkedin like secondconnections where they're friendlyand ask them be like hey i i see thatyou're a pm at a company i'm interestedincan you you know give me just somegeneral advice right and that'sall of this this this entire video hasbeen adviceand so just absorb as much of that asyou canand and that's the only resource rightis talk to people umyeah pm your job is talking to people soif you keep talking to people keeplearning um that's i think that's thebest you can do issurround yourself with people interestedin that same thing sowhat i'm i'm i'm thinking i hear you sayis you have to subscribe to the channelyeah that's what is what i've heard thatis absolutely rightshout out to you man like there's not alotof resources for for pms and so the factthat channelis something that exists like it goes along wayand i i kind of wish there was somethinglike this when i was in schooland again i mentioned right like in fiveyears somebody will have cracked thecode for pm interviewsyeah in five years somebody will havehavegot all these resources for aspiring pmsand doing these things and like this isavery very good place to get started so iappreciate the kind words thanksthanks so much for uh for giving allthis advice it's really gonna helppeople andyou have become a mentor to you knowmany people that will watch this videoum sokudos to
