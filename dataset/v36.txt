get two to three videosevery week that are gonna teach youhow to become the best candidatepossible and become a master interviewerdo me a favor while you're doing thathit that like button by hitting thatlike button you tell youtube i don'tsuckand i appreciate that let's talk aboutyour interview with applenow the first thing you want to dowhenever you're interviewing with anycompany is research research isimportantresearch is a differentiator if you gointo an interview with a company and youhaven't researchedthe probability of success is really lowjobs at apple are always going to becompetitive because a lot of people wantto work there so whenever you'reinterviewingum with them you're probably going upagainst four or five people who areequally qualified so you've got to standout there's no way you can go in thereand not give your best effort so thefundamentalsthe foundation of that is research sowhat do you want to do when you when youresearch a companywell first and foremost to be preparedyou want to go to their website familiaryou know familiarize yourself with theirproducts or services what do they dowhat do they make who do they servethose are things that at a basic levelyou want to be aware ofthe next you want to be aware of currentevents so apple does their big launchesso obviously you want to be aware ofthat but in addition to that go togoogletype in apple in the search bar and thengo and select newsand go down and read some recentarticles about apple what they're doingyou know anything that's going on withthem the next thing you want to do isyou want to research the job descriptionso whenever you're about to apply to ajobi want you to copy and paste that jobdescription into a word documentwhy the reason here is that a lot oftimes once you apply and other peoplehave appliedcompanies will actually remove the jobposting once they receive enoughcandidatesand if they do that you're not going tobe able to reference the job descriptionand see okayi'm in alignment here here here and hereand hereanytime you interview you want to printout the job descriptionlook at all the must-haves the nice tohaves most qualified candidates will beexperienced inblank and you want to look at that andsee those qualificationsand figure out how you line up and beprepared to talk to themso that's another thing you want to doand then the last thing you want to doin your foundation um when it comes topreparednessis you want to look at company cultureand values now with apple what you wantto do is on their biolike right in the bottom like right handcorner they have all their values listedoutand they actually have a page for eachof them so you can click on each oftheir valuesso what are these values so the valuesthat apple has is accessibilityeducationenvironment inclusion and diversityprivacyracial equity and justice and lastlysupplier responsibilitythey actually have all these valueslisted out and if you click on themit takes you to an entire web page thatshows you this is what it means to themthey do a great job they show youexplicitly what they mean what thosevalues mean to themand that is critical if they take thetime to spell it out like that then itshould be clear to you that these thingsare really important so familiarizeyourselfwith uh these values and be prepared tospeak to themyou know if they ask you a questionalong the lines of what about our valuesresonate with you you should be able toanswer this and it should be a layupbecause you have looked at theseyou have actually read okay here aretheir values hear what they're about andyou should be able to speak to themlet's talk about some of the specificquestions i know for a factthat you will be asked when youinterview at apple now the firstquestion is a really cool question andif you're a fan of appleit should be easy for you to answer butagain with any interview questionknowing it's coming is like 50 of thebattle and that question is what is yourfavorite apple device and whyum this really isn't about choosing theapple watch or your iphone or your ipadwhat it is about though is demonstratingknowledge and enthusiasm for the brandthat is what they're looking forum if i was personally answering this imight say something along the lines ofyou know that's actually a reallydifficult questionbecause i love my my iphoneum and i also love my apple watch umbut i guess even more than that i lovethe way they seamlessly work togetherum that is huge for me if i had to pickone though i'd probably go with mymy iphone i've had three or four of themthroughout the years and i just love thefunctionality of itsomething like that but they need tohear the passion they need to hear theknowledgethat is what they're looking for whenyou're answering this interview questionthe next question that i know for a factyou are going to get when you interviewwith appleis tell me about a time you completelyfailed and how did you bounce back fromitthis is such an interesting one for mebecause i i hear this question a lot iprofile differentcompanies i've profiled tesla i'veprofiled spacexi've profiled amazon after you're donewatching this go check out those videosbecause they're really neatum i really like the tesla and spacexone so definitely check those outum but the completely that word in thereis different because most of the timeit's tell me about a time if you failedand that's it but when when apple askedthis it's tell me about a time youcompletely failedand tell them and then how did youbounce back now normally when you'reasking this interview question you'relooking for two thingsum you're looking for authenticity sosomebody who is honest about andyou know can be um can be openum you know with you like here's a timei failed and they're lookingfor resilience you know how did youbounce backso this is a behavioral interviewquestion so you want to use the starmethodthat's situation tax taskaction and result right so what was thesituation you were in what was the taskyou needed to completewhat was your specific action to resolvethe issue and then what was the resultthey're looking forauthenticity and vulnerability thenthey're looking for your responseyou know how did you respond you knowhow did you demonstrate resilienceum and then lastly one of the thingsthat i think is important it should besomething that's not soworrisome that they're like oh my godthat was a terrible decision-makingprocesshow did this person do that bonus tiphere whenever i'm given an exampleof a time i have failed or i didsomething wrong it is beneficial to dothat like earlier in your careeryou want to do that as something you didfive six seven years agonot five six seven months ago the nextquestion is tell me about a time youdisagree with your managerhow did you handle it and what was theoutcome this again is a behavioralinterview question anytime you hear thewordstell me about a time or can you give mean example when that's a behavioralinterview question and it meansonce again star method situation taskaction result so that's what you'rethinking about here this questionspecifically they want to know aboutyour professionalism your ability tomanageup um that is that's important here youwant to show respect to your manager solay out a scenario in which maybe yourmanager didn't have visibility tosomethingand they told you to do something andyou realized ah they don't see what isee there's a better way to do thisso you went to them with data withinformationyou explain the situation and ultimatelythey sided with you and said ah thankyou benyou're right let's do it your way that'sthe kind of situationyou want to be laying out when youanswer this interview question and ifyou can do thatthen you'll succeed in answering it iwant to talk about a few more behavioralsituational questionsbecause apple's pretty heavy on them thenext one is what is something you havedonein this life that you were particularlyproud of and whythis is interesting because i hear thequestion um what is your mostsignificant career achievementa lot it is a very common interviewquestion i ask the interview questionum and whenever you're doing that you'relooking for a few things you wantsomething significantand you want them to be able to answermultiple follow-up questions about itnow they said something you've done inyour life that you're particularly proudof so this to me opens it up to talkingabout getting your degreemaybe getting your master's degree maybesomething you did that you're reallyproud of running a marathonum the fact they said in your life givesyou flexibilityif it was me though i might try to finda way to say something that i did in mycareerthat was impactful for a lot of waysbut was also something i'm passionateabout right if it's a problem you solvethat you're passionate about that wassignificantthat shows bits and pieces of who youare as a person but who you arealso professionally that's absolutelynailing this question the one key herethoughis you need to be able to answerfollow-up questions so a lot ofcompanies will ask thisand you'll give an example of the timeyou solved a big problem at work andthey'll go okay great how long did ittake for you to solve thisokay how many people were involved whatdid you specifically do and what did theteam dothen what was the most significantlearning moment in hereor what was the turning point in whichyou had an aha momentmade a change that resulted in thesuccess of this product ben what werethe cycle timesthat's like a specific technicalfollow-up uh i've heard spacex actuallyask that to inquire further whensomeone's giving what was your mostsignificant career achievementbut you get you get the drift here rightanybodywho's going to say this is the mostsignificant thing i've done in my lifeor careershould be able to answer multiplefollow-up questions about itthis is no different you need to beprepared to do that and if you can dothat you'll pass this questionthe next question is how have you dealtin the past with a difficult customeragain behavioral so you want to take thestar approach but the keyhere is showing um your willingness todo so right because if they're askingyoutell me about a time that you've workedwith a difficult customeryou have to let them know that you'reokay doing this because it's probablysomething you're gonna have to do againso maybe start off by answering thisquestion go you know that's somethingi've done frequently and it actuallyi enjoy this because it gives me anopportunity to represent my companyand solve a problem for a customer mostcustomerswho have some sort of customer complaintjust want their issue resolved they'rehappy with the company otherwise theywould just leave and choose anotherservicebut because they're choosing to voice acomplaint it means they're a customer wecan savethat's a powerful foundation foranswering this question now beyond thereyou have to demonstrate patience andyour ability to resolve the issueif you can do those things you willanswer this interview question withflying colorsso do that now this next one is aquestion i love i think it's super coolthis is again customer focusedum so if you're in a customer-facingrole at all you might get this questionbut i think it's so neat i've neverheard this question asked anywherebut apple asks it and it goes if you hadto prioritize between fixing acustomer's problemor creating a great customer experiencewhich would you choosewhich do you think is more important andwhywow ideally you can do both of thesethings right you can fix a problem butyou can also improve experiencehere's how i see it i've done a fairamount of research on apple and applereally prioritized customer experiencethey want your experience with any oftheir products to be seamless seamlesslyinformation goes from your apple watchto your phone about fitnessabout your health about usage so for mei would tell this would be my response iwould tell them that for me i think moreimportantis customer experience because you canretain a customerwhen you don't solve their problem butthey have a great experience with youso that's what i would do now in aperfect world you do both of thesethingsbut the reality is you can fix someone'sproblem and they could still be reallymiserable with the experience they hadwith your companyand go elsewhere so what's more powerfulcustomer experience to me customerexperience is the ultimatedifferentiatorand it really is in line with apple'svalues so that is how i would answerthat interview question and i think ifyou say that you will absolutely passthe next question that apple asked andthis is a common interview question soit shouldn't be too hardbut it's tell me about a time that youwent above and beyond for a customeragainbehavioral interview uh questions so youhave to use a star methodbut here's the key a lot of people getthis question wrongbecause instead of giving one succinctanswer they just start rambling on abouta bunch of different times they'vehelped customersrecruiters hate this hiring managershate this hr people hate thisif they ask you for a specific exampleand you giveeight so-so examples you are failingthis interview questionso you have to make sure you do this theother thing people do wrongwhen they answer this question is theanswer isn't above and beyondthey give you an answer that's like welli thought that was your job wouldn'tthat be what you're doinglike for me i'm in recruitment and ifsomebody asked me ben give me a timewhere you went above and beyond for acustomer and i was like wellone time i had a search i was on it wasreally difficult but i ended up findingtheir personin the back of their mind they're gonnago well isn't that your job ben where isthe above and beyond hereso you have to keep that in mind whensomeone asks you to demonstrate a timeyou went above and beyondactually give them above and beyond ifyou just give them your jobthat is not doing it so remember onesuccinct answershow that you are comfortable doing itbe detailedshow resolution be specific with whatyou did and make sure it'sactually above and beyond i worked intothe night i worked over the weekendi went and talked to somebody in anotherdepartment and worked with them to findresolution whatever it is make sure it'sactually above and beyondnow here i want to talk about aleadership question in case you wereinterviewingwith apple for a role where you willhave people responsibilitythis is one of the questions i found inall my research multiple timesand it's telling me about a time youdealt with a situation where you had anemployee give you pushback on asuggestionand how do you respond in a lot of waysthis is like the reverse of the questionwe talked about earlier where you had toelevate something to your managerwell this is like well now you're themanager and they're bringing somethingto youso here's what i would say here this isa great leadership questionit's an awesome opportunity to showhumility as a managerso be the type of manager who hears themoutlistens gathers all the information andsolves conflict in a way whereyou know everybody's everybody's happyright you listen to themyou understood the information you tooktheir perspectiveand you found resolution that was greatfor all parties involved that's reallywhat it is again this is a behavioralinterview questionso situation tax actionresult that's what you want to be doingstar method now i want to talk about twocompanies specific rolesor questions rather these are thingsthat they want to ask and anybody couldbe asked thisthe first one is why do you want to workfor appleand this this is a basic question whereif you're interviewing when anylike every interview you do for the restof your life be able to answer thisquestion for the companynow when it comes to apple how do youanswer this the best answers alwaysinvolve the combination of three thingsone um your admiration for the companyyou're interviewingright that's foundation piece number onenumber twovalue alignment why are you a goodculture fit why do you sharevalues that's number two and then numberthree why the role you're specificallyapplying tois perfect for where you want to be inyour career today this is where you wantto gothis is where you're taking your careeryou're passionate about the role and theresponsibilitiesif you can hit on all these three likeall three of these thingsin your answer you're absolutely goingto crushthis interview question this next one'sreally cool it's one of those ones whereif you've researched it it's going to besoeasy to answer but if you haven'tresearched it you're going to have noideaand so here's the question apple changedits name from apple computersincorporated to apple incdo you know why the change was made sohere's why it was officially made soduring his keynote speechat the mac world expo on january 9th2007steve jobs announced that apple computerincwould thereafter be known as apple incbecause the company has shifted itsemphasis from computers to consumerelectronicsthat's the answer don't recite that wordfor word like i just didfind a way to make it your own don't beoverly rehearsed but basically you couldsay you know ibelieve there was a a an event in whichsteve jobs announcedthey were doing that because of theshift from just computers to moreconsumer electronics likethe apple watch or the iphone that's theanswerthat's how you answer it like honestlythis question is soeasy if you have access to thisinformationbut if like you never heard that storyhow would you answer it i don't knowso so now i want to get into like acouple just regular questions that idon't think are company related but youcould get anywhereum and i'm gonna be honest i don't lovethem but i know they ask about apple soi want you to be prepared to answer themthe first one iswhere do you see yourself in five yearsihate this interview question and here'swhy statistically it's more likely thatneither of youare at apple in five years because theaverage tenure of an employeein america and probably worldwide but inamerica for sureit's 3.1 years so if you take this jobin two weeksthey offer it to you today you acceptyou start in two weeks 3.1 years you'reprobably working somewhere else maybeyou're at spacex or teslaor netflix or wherever but the odds areyou're not going to be therethat being said you can say that as aninterview response that is a terribleinterviewresponse don't say that here's what iwould do people make the mistakeof talking about the next role you knowand then it leaves people thinking wellare they actually interested in thisrole which is stupid because they askedyouyou answered and now they'resecond-guessing your motivation sohere's what you saystart off with the foundation of youknow that's a really great questionright now in my career i'm reallyfocused on moving into a role like thisbecause i want to expand my ability inabchowever i see myself learning andgrowing and in five yearsi'd like to be making the type of impactblankthis is nice because it doesn't say aspecific role you can say a specificrolemake it one that's reasonable to bethere in five years don't make it onethat's like three or foursteps ahead of where this next job wouldbe maybe the next step up that's finebut i like talking about your currentroleyour current interest you being goodhere and then the type ofimpact you're able to make um in theworldin five years this specifically fitswell with appleand their mission in my opinion becauseif you look at the values there's a lotof alignment therethat's how you answer it the nextquestion i hate it i can't i actuallycan't believe apple asked this but ifound it umon two different sites and it's what'syour favorite food or ice creamthis might be one of those questionsthat a company asksum just to get you loose and get youtalkingi don't know what it has to do withworking an apple or being an engineer orwhatever they want you to do but just beprepared don't be thrown off by itmy favorite ice cream is coffeehaagen-dazsis perfection feel free to use that nowthe last question i'm going to teach youhow to answer before we move into thetechnical questionswhere i will offer you no helpwhatsoeverum is if you accept a job at apple whatwill you miss most about where youcurrently workhere's a key don't say something youwon'tbe able to get it apple right sosometimes people say you know i'm reallygonna missthis specific thing we do at my currentcompany and deep down in the recruiter'sheadpart of them goes oh man we we can'toffer this at you knowthis at apple maybe this person isn'tgonna want to take this jobdon't do that instead say something likeyou know what honestlyi'm going to miss working with my teami've got a great teami'm a type of person who's really teamoriented and we'vegone through a lot of things over theyears and you know i am going to missworking with some of themhowever i'm really looking forward tothe team that i'll get to work with atapple because i knowthe value alignment of the people youhire is going to be really spot on withme personallyand i know that i can look for that sametype of camaraderie at applethere you go easy done say that so realquick i feel compelled to sayi am not a technical person i have abachelor's degree in businessand i have an mba but i have gone toschool for nothing technical so i am notgoing to help youanswer any of these questions i'm goingto tell you what they are so you can doyour own researchand i'll actually leave them all in thedescription box so you can go down therecopy and paste it go find the answersand then nail it in your interview withapple so the first question is explainwhat a modem and a router are to aneight-year-oldi'm gonna give you a little i'd like iliterally said i'm not gonna help youi'm gonna help you a little bitthis is just about making sure you canexplain conceptsthat are difficult to somebody whodoesn't have your education andbackgroundso make it simple make it easy to followthe next questionexplain what ram is to a five-year-oldkind of the same deal heremake it easy to follow um you know oneof the things that's funny is when italk to candidates from the militarysometimes they useall these um these acronyms and i end upsaying heyum could you start over i don'tunderstand what that acronym you said isand they go ah okay yeah let me do thatso just make sure what you're sayingis understandable to somebody whodoesn't have your technical backgroundthat's the key therethe next question how would you derive aconfidence intervalinterval excuse me from a series of cointosses i could wager a guess herenot going to do it but i bet you canthat's the questionthe next one's kind of technical but notbut i'll just place it here and you canyou can figure it outum if a person called for tech supportbut had a dinosaur producthow would you handle it i'm assumingthey don't need an actual product madefor dinosaurs but an old onebut you're probably the tech expert soi'll leave that up to you here's thenext questionhow would you check to see if the leftand right were mirror imagesof a binary tree lastly how would youtest a toaster me personally i'd putbread in it while it was toasting iwould smash avocadothen when it pops i would put someveganese some pesto veganies on thebreadthen i would mash the avocado then iwould put somebangkok blend seasoning from pensiespices on it and i'd makeexcellent avocado toast they're probablylooking for something differentpersonally though that's what i dowell there you have it those are all thequestions umhere's the thing all of you out thereare probably going to nail thesetechnical questionsso it's really important to nail theones that aren't technical in naturebecause that's where you're gonnadifferentiate yourself if you'rewatching this it probably means you havean interview with applewhich probably means your qualificationsare amazing you're gonna crush thetechnical portionmake sure you don't skimp on the firstpart of this video becausethat is where you will differentiateyourself and that is how you're going toland your job at applegood luck in the interview you've gotthis
