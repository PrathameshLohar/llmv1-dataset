♪ Music playing ♪♪Open.Open a door, and it opens all the others.Open a mind, and see what happens next.No great thing, no beautiful inventionwas created in a vacuum.It happens when we leave our comfort zoneand come together,embrace faiths, cultures, disabilities, differences.Embrace races, ages, ideologies, personalities,creating a tool or device nobody saw coming.Humanity is plural, not singular.The best way the world worksis everybody in,nobody out.So, who we're made of is everyone.Differences not just celebrated but essential.Many more women in charge,equal pay for equal work everywhere.A new generation of Apple,more diverse than the one that came before.Open is not just who we are,but what we believe as a company.Because humanity isn't singular.It's plural.♪The truth is, we don't see things the same.The power is, we don't see things the same.♪
