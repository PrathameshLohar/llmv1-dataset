hellohello hello can you hear me yes can youhear meyeah i can hear you okay perfectexcellent umso hi uh my name is martin i'm callingyou frominterviewing.io and is this still a goodtime to talkyeah sure so my name is pankajgood to meet you umokay so uh this is how i see thisinterview going umnormally i would like toum have you introduce yourself givegive your background probably in ain about five minutes um and theni would i would suggest to keep it shortso you have more time for your algorithmfor your programming assignment and thenfor about 40 minutes we'll have uhtime again to work on your programmingassignment anduh at the end of the intro we'll i'lltry to say five to ten minutes for usto just to talk to see if you have anyquestionsso yeah so i'm bankrupt i am uh soi graduated from a universityin computer engineering back in 2018 andi joined a payment companyback in 2019 as a software engineer andright now i'm working on a dataprocessing and analytics systemactually that caters to the audience andshows them a lot of analytics regardingtheir deployment strategies and allokay excellent sowhat would be since this the century islanguage agnostic uh i would still uhwould like to know what is your languageof the the preferred languageto be intrigued sure i prefer toactually use python most of the timesince it'smore compact and precise yeahsure sounds good umokay um i can change this for yousure it would be great all right nextone now let mepaste let me paste the programmingassignment and let me modify a littlebit thecommentsokay first umwhy don't you go ahead and try to readtheassignment and tell me if you have thisif you have seen this problem before ifif youhave maybe we can uh have a differentquestion if notum let's uh let's break it downand uh let's work on it sureso you are given a 2d metric pleasewrite a functionthat returns number of islands in agiven matrixisland is combination of ones there aresurrounded byzeroes of matrix border uhisland one okay so actually i have seenthis questionbut it's been like way back i haven'tpracticed this kind of thing in a whileokay so do you do you want to work inthis problem or do you want to umhave a different question i think yeahthis problem is good i want to do thisone sinceit would be almost as if i'm starting asessionyeah and it's fairly common it's fairlypopularquestion um during the interview so ithink it's good to practiceyeah sure exactlyso yeah so what i could remember isthere is there is a 2d matrix andall the islands so the so thelands are all one and zeros areuh the water right the water partso the land would be sayone island would be this because it'ssurrounded by zero zero and borderso this would be one island fromthis and this this forms one island andthensimilarly uh thisand this will form another island sothere are 12 islandswhat if so what aboutthe country so what are the conditionsare they going to besurrounded by the uhright left top and bottommatrix the bottom elements or they canbejoined by the diagonal elements as welllikewhat if say instead of this 0 it was a 1then we could have considered thisentirething as one island or still it would beoneisland here and one island here sincethis is joined by a diagonalyeah so a great question so if you haveum another one in herethen we would have one islandright just one island because so thecorner also counts right say it againthe corner the diagonal agency adjacencyalso countsyes gotcha very good questionall right so what i'mthinking is going to be it's so it'sit's basicallykind of a graph now we have to traversethe graphand see uh where are we encountering allthe onesand basically keep a track of itas soon as so our stop condition will beif you reach all the way down hereor if you do if you reach any of theedgesand you cannot go say right or youcannot go right or top because it'sboundarythen you have to stop there and you haveto move in the to thetowards the way where you can movebasicallyand which has which has not been coveredbyany other movement that you have beendoing sothat would be one of the way okay nowthe important thing here isuh you would keep track of whatum what elements you already havevisited else you canend up in a loop and it will go downand it will never you'll never come outof the loopso good pointyeah uh do you want me to start writingso before we jump on it uh what wouldyouuh say the runtime complexity going tobewith the graph approach so if we do agraph approach saybasically it's going to be a depth forsearchand the runtime complexity will alwaysbeof and and given m equal to the numberof elements so if you take it in termsofrows and column which is r and c it willbeo of r and c so it will be a linearuh complex time complexityall right excellentsounds great let's do itso i'm gonna see the number of islandsand parameters would be the grid say itis a gridand i'll be declaringsomething like uh totalislands which initiallyis set to zeroand then ah i want toactually uhi want to uh declare something calledparts so basically this will i'll storethe paths that i can go from say hereor anywhere the possible paths that ican proceedthe possible paths would be and i wantto store itin tuples for example if i sayone and one so that means i canmove x coordinate i can move one xcoordinate and y coordinateone y coordinate so if it is zero zeroherezero plus one and then again in columnzeroplus one so that will be one one so thatwill behere i can move here so similarly if ido something like zero and zerosorry zero and one and then i can moveone and zero then i can movebut all i can move if it's zero and onethen i'll be movinguh one column that will be here if it'sone and zero i'll be moving hereyeah and hereif it is here i can move backwards aswell right soi can move minus 10 and i can movezero minus one xeominus one and minus oneso that's okay one twothree four and then fivesix seven eightthere are not eight herei just got secondsso what is the value of this pathagainyes so i'm gonna do like a currentcoordinates which would be thecoordinates that i'm currently in sayfor this one i've beenone and one and then i'll i'llgo to all the possible parts sayif i do if i choose this then i'll addmy x coordinate to this x coordinatethat will be my future pathand my y coordinate current y coordinateto thisuh y coordinate that will be my future ycolumnso from any given coordinate you want tosee which path do youuh should you go and check for valueyeah i see okayso i think i'm missing two here becauseitook care of this and this and i'm gonnatake care of thisand this and that would be if i'mhere and if i want i'm sorry if i'mhere if i want to go here so that willbean increase in column sorry an increasein row and a decrease in column so thatwould be 1 minus 1.and similarly minus one and onewould give me the other one the oppositeoneall right and now i have to i'm justuh storing my row lengthblue one problemsay great andnow for each uh i have to go foreach element i have to keep movingso let's see foractuallyumrangesoso uh i'm gonna calculate my future partso my future position so my futureposition equal touh my current positionforeignand this second one would bei'm gonna just use the word for thatall right so does this make sense sowhat i'm doing here isi calculate my current position which isnothing but the row and the columnand where i'm gonna move is my futureposition which iscurrent position zero and uh zero plusuh yeah so basically i am adding thefirst value of my path my path beingthisand my current position 0 which isx x coordinate plus the mu plus thex coordinate of the path which gives methe x coordinate of myfuture position and i'm gonna do itfor all here now i'm gonna check whetheri can move there or notso still i have still i haven't uhcoded what would be the condition wherei would becounting whether this is an island ornotright okaymy conditions are basicallyalso i have to make sure that i havevisited the pathand what how am i gonna do that isi cani can keep a track off uh i can justkeepanother grid another gridas a as a memory basically i can usesomething like a memoization techniquewhere i can keep another grid of thesamedimension and adjust the basic binaryvalue true or falsefor example if i do[Music]represented[Music]ori have a question future future positionum are there any corner cases withfuture positionyeah so there will be future phases withuh corner cases with future position forexample when you are going to hitwhen you are going to overflow this waysowhere you are when you are going tooverflow say uhminus one and something like zero andminus one something likewhich is which would be less than thetotal length of which would be less thanzeroor greater than the length of a rulecolumnfor each part so that will be our futurethat will be our corner case and that wecan handle when we areuh visiting that future position so wewon'tvisit the future position if uh we hitthe corner caseexcellent thank youso thanks forso i'm creating a visitedmemory visited map where i'll i'mkeeping everything first as falseand here i'm gonna donow i'm gonna checkhow much i have to check where my uhconditionsend like where do i increment mytotal number of islands so if sayif i start from here and this is not aoneand my future if i end up here and thisis not a onei do nothing with the total number ofislandsand say if i end up here then what i dois i'm going to increment my totalisland to1 butagain if i'm going to end up here i'mnot going to increment my totalcount to 1 so the onlycondition whereokay the only condition where i'm goingto implement my totalisland toone would be a gas hereand the condition here ismy future position whenmy future position here would be thisthis and this and my future positionsand they are not visited yet and if theyare all zerothen i can increment it then i canincrementmy total number of islandsto one okayso umjust to summarize it where exactly areyou planning to increase the number ofislandsin your in your traversing logicuh if i'm here and my current and myfuture positionso if my current position is say hereand my future positions and which arenot visited yetand that and say i come from here andhere iend up here i have already visited theseandsay i have i would be just traversingthe next thingi'll be traversing is to a zero herethen but that is not rightyeah that would not be rightso um i have a question to youso justvisually walk me throughum how umthe depth first search uh algorithmworksuh the dfs algorithm sureso uh the dfs algorithm would basicallywork from eachuh position you would go to everyyou'd first traverse to every otherpositionat the other possible position say ifyoustart from here first first yousay first you are going down so if yougo downthen for this position again you can godownthis way this way and all other wayso basically you'd be traversing thedepth firstand then you'd be tracing back andwhatever paths are not coveredyou'll be travelling those positionsright andso once you find your first oneright yeah you you ran into the islandor east of irelandyou ran into your first one and thenalgorithmyour algorithm should and i think that'swheretowards what you're moving is youralgorithm shouldkeep traversingum the matrixor grid to the point where it foundold ones or it ran out of the optionsfor this island right so it ran into thewater or it foundold ones yeahit's right it's got to be somethingright recursivecalls it has to keep checking thisfuture position forevery of the um next elementsright so you are saying if i start fromhereuh if i start from zero i should not betraversing anywhere because i am on zeroi should be only traversing when mycurrent position is a oneright and then i have to figure out whatwould beif i if i start from onesay one then i have to figure out wheredo i have to stop as wellright and right you're rightso that would be herei am at one my future position sayso uh i i would start at one only afteri have covered thisright because uh i won't do any dfss ifi'm at zeroif i'm at zero then i go here if ium so yeah so something likefor each row so my current position theni i would bechecking if uh my currentposition if redoff rho and colonis equal to equal to one then i would bedoing a dfsauh dfs herealso uhhere i would besetting up the visited aswith relatedandequal to trueso here i have to do a dss nowi should probably modularize it andwrite another functioncalled the pssand what would be myparameters again gridand my say umcurrent positionthis is here like thisand this one will beworth dfss with the greatelements and like currentpositionyep you're on the right trackall right sothis one is gonna come toyesokay so also this is my future positionand i'm gonna see iffuture positionnow if you createbeauty positionsactually this would be more easy if ijust name it as a futurecurrent tax current y and future xfuture why isn't itas i have to every time i have to uhyeahyeah i think the name you can mentionyeahcurrent x equal to rhoand herewhyy the truei'm going to and the same thingand basically my futurex equal to pointx plus part0 and myh volumethis isand now i i need to doa condition first and my condition firstis check the boundary condition iffuturefuture x is auh less than zero which should beno so yeah it is greater than zeroand less thanthe length of my uhlow length basicallyand my futurey is basicallygreater than zeroand less thanthe columnlengthalso there is one more condition whichisand griduh futurex andfuture yequal to equal to one then basicallykeep traversingand we basically uh recurse itright request my dfsoh sorry request with gridand uh now myuh current x and current y would be myfuture xand future yoh there's somethingbeautythere you gookay and also i have to make sure that iam notlooping up because i have so if uhif i'm starting from here so thereso the future x and future y this mythis is a valid future x and future ybut i have already visited this so if igo here again then i'llend up in the loop so i don't want toend up in a loop so there should beanother conditionand notvisitedfuturethis is this is invalid syntax basicallythis you can seeso yeah this is how i'm gonna do my dfsfrom here so basically when i'mhere uh wherever i sobasically i have eliminated thisposition i am not going herei have basically eliminated the cornerthis one as welli have eliminated this as well becausethis has already been visitedand this as well so the only thing i'mleftleft with is i'm going to visit thisthisand this and nothing elseso uhyeah so the only key the only thingremains here is when am i going touhuh also i have to make sure i do myi set my visited thing here as well[Music]all right so i have to see atwhat condition am i going to incrementmy valuemy total number of islands valueso that would bethe elf condition i guess nowelse condition i cannot do it in the abselse condition becausesay if i'm here there would be auh an else condition here as well i canimplement my values thereso remember when we talked thatthe moment you hit oneright you havefound the island you don't know how bigthe island is but you have found theislandand then you keep traversing yeah sobasically this isa code where i'm just traversing now istillhaven't uh figured out like how to trackhow how to keep track of number ofislands that i havetravish right rightand but that's but that's what butthat's where i'm leading you towards soyou you found the island right you raninto the first oneyeah that means you found the island andthen youthat first search does all the job rightit'skeep traversing until it ran intothe water into zeroes or found all theonesand then you keep going you're checkingor you're lookingyou already have one island you keeplooking for the other for the secondislandthen you run into another one rightthat's your second island and then yourthat first search kicks in againright exactly so that's what i'm sayingso i was thinkingi can do it here actually so here i canjust add another conditionand it is not in visited and then asbecause my i'm taking my dfs from hereand this dfs will stop and this dssis going to stop when the island isgoing theconnection is going to break so this dfsis going to stop hereso the next dss will kick off from hereand that's when i can increment my nextislandright right so whenever i hita one i can just increment my islandtotal number ofislandplus equal to one also i have to makesure the same conditions support here aswell is grade equal to equal to one andnotuh resistedyeah so i think i'm just gonna go oncethrough the entire code and let's see ifit makes sense because to meit's it it makes sense but i'm justgoing to repeat it so that we are almostboth of us are in the same place uhso yeah so i have first of all umi declared a variable called totalislands which i'm going tokeep track of number of islands that i'muh hitting likea number of disconnected islands andthenyeah disconnected islands disconnectedby land yeah and the and inpart is an array of tuples where i havekeptuh eight possible paths that i cango where my future coordinates can befrom my current coordinatesand then row length and column lengthare just the length of row and columnand visited is a map or is again anm cross and grid of boolean variablesfirst of all it isinitialized with false because i havenot visited any of thegrids yet sonext this tfs okay nextit will start from here the control soi'm going to traverse through each andeveryelement starting from here so if i startfrom the topleft it's going to if first of all it'sgoing tosave save in memorythe status ofvisit so it's going to say that okayi am i have visited 0 now it's going toseeif the thread and column equal to equalto one which is notso it's just going to go forward whichis the second elementso same thing it's going to uh keep theuh keep the track keep a track of thestatus of visit here here till herenow we are hitting this one now when wehit this elementit this is going to kick in which isgrid row 1 column equal to equal to 1and not visited row and column which istrue we have oh which is actually nottruei think this condition is at the wrongplaceyeah this condition should benow this condition is at the right placei guessjust thatyeah i don't think i uhi should be doing this yeahthis is not necessary this is actuallythis will produce false results yeah soi uh mark the status as visited equal to2 and i see that this is a 1so i increment the value to one thenumber of island and i do a dfsso uh okay so in tfs it's going tovisit now it's going to enumeratethrough all the possible pathsand all the possible parts will be herethis one this one this oneand this and this and the corner casewhich is this and all this corner casewhich would be get which would geteliminated from this conditionand the only thing that the only elementthat is going to visit is this oneand then it's going to mark it asvisited and then it is going to markthis oneit it is going to come here it is goingto mark that as visitor that is going tocome here its format that is visitednow when it comes here its not going toif when it comes here or here orsee here theuh the the traverse actually stopsthe towers because because of all thiscondition because we have alreadyif it is here we have already visitedthis soit's not going to go there so the onlycondition is hereand since the next one isthe future any of the future why any ofthe possiblefuture y is not going to be a one it isgoing to stop hereso again it will come out of the dfsslopeit will again incrementso now we were here it will goincrement increment to this onenow this is the tricky conditionbecause when it comes here it is goingtoincrement the total is 2 but i shouldnot bebecause i should not be do it should nottrigger the dfs hereand that's why keeping this condition istricky herei'm thinking where should i put thisconditionor i do not need this condition at allhere because this condition is beingtakencare hereso in your that first searchwhen you land on your first umthe first traversal you are umyou are passing current x and corn y andthey're equal to onerightwhich means you have to mark it asvisitedbut post fact them though yeah i meanyeah after this not hereso i'm thinking ifbecause here i am doing a visited futurex future yequal to true which is necessaryand if i do a visitedcurrent ah if i do thisvisited[Music]here current x and current y equal totruethat should workand i can hereyeah and notyeah this would work so when i uh thenext time when i start from here it willsee that it has already been visited andit's going toskip that and souh so again when we advance hereagain this is since this is not a oneit's not going to kick in not going tokick in here not going to kick in herenot here because visited not herevisitednot here as well because this is also uhbecause this is not equal to one thenhere is going to kick in againbecause this was never visited and thisis a oneand it will it will increment the totalnumber of islands value toone and it will take off the dfs areaand the only thing i'd love to do isreturnthe total number of itemsi think you have a cycle yeahi know because i yeah this is this islike a couple of years after i'm doingthis up fresh i know this lookcode looks messy this can be improved alot i guessbut uh from time as you can see why isthis is the best i guessyeah i mean i agree that that firstsearch was the way to go umand um i think your code looks good umthe only thing i would probably move outthat for searchnot have it declared within the functionjust move it out but for now let's let'sjustgo ahead and run it umyeah so i think the the logicand the code looks looks good good tobug intouh yeah try toprint our sample use caseelementsokay can i just copy this oneyou can just declare it um i didn't putany i did i didn't assign it to anyvariable sooh yeah i can just do already let's seeis input reserved word or notinput is moderator but why is it a colori don't knowthe same oneokay it's going it's giving the threeinstead oftwo i guess somewhere itis the logic is plot somewhereso let's see if i give it does a onethen is it going to give me as twoyeah it should give me one one butit's giving me one extra for some reasonandif i can keep it here let'sprinthere checking inand i'm going to print my show onecolumnokay one zero which is expectednot 2 0 which is not expectedwhy is it so that means it is notthe 2 0 which is this one was notcovered in thisdfs i have to look atthat have i not covered it in tfsis it because of the path one twothree four five six seven eightyeah and it is correctand this one will this one should bex plus uhzero and sorry x plus 1and y plus 0 so 1 0 i have a 10.yeah the pro must be either in somethingin that if statementsomewhere we're not marketing is visitedi'm trying to see if the pathdeclarationuh let's printcan you print out the visitorsyeah i can print out the widget as wellherethen uh you can print it out once at theendafter the dfs or here okayyeah before the return statement or theor you can do it therewhy is my visitors my visitor look soweirdyeah my visitor just havetwo rows for some reasonno um are we missing theumshould the second four loop also bewrapped into thesquare bracketall right this looks rightuh false for blank and rangecolumn length which would be the inneroneyes and then for in row lengthrow length is number field number zerothislooks weird to me[Music]umsostillone two three four and that's justfour four one and twowell it should be a four cross fivecross four matrixand all i'm saying is one two threefour five cross two matrixso does that man my manmy column length my row length isdo you also find it oh yesyeah i'm trying to research how pythondeclares 2d matrixum um python is not my language soi'm justlooks like that's the that's the rootcauseoh okay check this out umlet me just copy paste thatlooks likeum looks like you need ai and j versusoh now actually this is just a blankoperator which youdo not need to use it anywhere becausewe are not using in that waybut here is what i am saying actuallyi see my visited row and column lengthas four five four cross five which istrue because i am printing it out hereand the next thing i printmy visitedis actuallyoh i think this is the correct onejust that uh yeah yeahi think i'm getting the right thing onetwo three and fourit's just the length of it that was aproblemso i think the visitor is gettinginitialized correctly it'ssomewhere else that isthe problemyeah it's somewhere else uhit's just getting a oneit's just getting an extra island iscounting an extra island every timewhat if i just youtubethis instead this would bewait but visited is still a 5x2 matrixright five by twoand that's what i see from the printoutoh is it yeah yeah it's a four crossfive sorry uh yeah four cross fiveso one two three four rows and fivecolumnseach of them has five columns so oh okaynever mind yeah i cani can say it now so i'm just going togo a smaller input and clike a two cross two and try to deworkthat will be more easyi think the edge case is where it isfailing what if there are nouh islands at allthat is the artwork ceilingoh no that's not the part where it isfailingand what if i just do onewhich is one okay andif i extend it to one herethat is going to give me two yeah thisis the part where it's ceilingand if i do a zero here if i do a onehereyeah yeahso put the initial conditionso it's d17 so let's implementing[Music]wellactually no yeah kicking inzero onesince we are marking we're markingvisited umwe're marking visited on every thatfirst searchyeah and then we're marking it onceagain can you remove the secondassignment of true the one inside of thestatementokaystillokay well looks like it's umsorry we ran out of time but uh greatdebugging session i think it's justsome corner case that we're missing i'mnot able to spot it neitheryeah yeah i think i'm gonna work on thisit isit is the right approach uh code looksgoodum yeah debugging was great uh it's justthat one corner case which is a veryminor thingso um do youhave any uh questionsuh actually yeah so this is my firsttime in interviewing dot io i havelike this are you like a seasonedinterviewer andare you here or have you just started iti have been doing the interviews tointroduce youoh okay okay soso uh so one thing would be i want toget some feedback on so sometimes what iuh what happens is if i see for examplethis kind of problem thateven if i have not done it or practiceditand i missed it in my practice sessionor whatever i tend to getnervous and like i tend to like getblanksometimes and uh sometimes it happensthat you even in this interview youmight have felt that there were somepauses like some awkward pauses for saytwo or three minutes where itwent to completely silent so that wasjust i think i was just thinkingsomething sowould would that count as a negativething in an interviewbecause i sometimes find that uh if iwant to concentrate anduh if i have not seen the problem and iwant to think about the problem ineed a little you know little uh poshtime to think it through andi cannot like uh i know i could not tendtotalk and think at the same time sohow do you feel about that generallyspeakinguh it's important to voiceall of your thoughts i understand thatit's mucheasier and you're not along herethat it's easier just to think silentlyright to focus on something for theinterviewerit's important to hear your thoughtprocessso and anything that you think of and uhmaybe you think ofin the wrong direction so into you canintercept that and uhyou know guide you on on on where hewants youhe or she wants you to umto be in so generally speakingum i would say two three minutes it'sit i would not recommend[Music]or just go ahead and say you know whatgive me atwo two minutes i need togather my thoughts but something youhave togive a heads up why there isum a silence right butuh again it's it's very much recommendedtovoice um any of your thoughts during theinterviewi see no that makes complete sense rightand would what i would suggest i thinkoverallyou did really good um what i wouldsuggestum generally it's better to haveum i know it's hard to follownormally you write your test before youwriteyour algorithm but if you haveum i would say walk through ofthrough one example uh this uh not justverbally buton the paper right you say okay i'mgoing toindex um x but now i'm moving to index xplus onex minus one and things like that justwrite it all downso it's it's much more clearfor the interviewer um umwhere your thoughts are heading to whereis your algorithm headingto uh so generally writinga small test case beforehand will help alotumthat would be the only feedbackthat i would uh suggest umas of as a right so for example in thiscase instead of thisbig input i could have like started witha small use case andthat would have been like much easier todebug i guess rightyeah yeah see it's it's hard to catchall of the corner casesum in your head umso it's better just to start coming upwithuse cases right and all the use caseswill come to you once you start writingyour first test rightyou or okay once you walk someonethrough your firsttask um scenario then all these thingswill pop upso it's yeah it's strongly recommendedto have theto have all of the all of this it forthe interviewer by the way umi think i will as an entry willappreciateengineer to um notjump into thesolution right away rather try toum drill down on all possible use casesand cover all the questions before wecome up with a solution i think thatthat makes total sense yesokay well it was a pleasure uh speakingwith you todayum again great um and great exercisegreat debugging andgreat uh problem solving skillsi hope uh yeah i'll um i'll provide afeedback right after this interview soyou should be receiving the feedbackshortlyand i hope you enjoy the rest of yourweekend coolthank you i'll thank you thanks
