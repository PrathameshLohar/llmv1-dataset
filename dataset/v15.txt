all right so imagine I give you a 2dmatrix we have someone this okay I wantyou to return the spiral order of thematrix voice firing order you ask let meexplainso we come to start at the top left onthe go all the way across we go downleft up middle so we spiral through thematrix okay all right so we always startat top left and then go right always goright down left end up and what we'retalking through so we're trying topredator or return a list of older yeaha list of all the numbers in the matrixokay so I'm guessing it's smallerbeating is this number be like an equalRho is equal polymer matrix matrix yeahthat's a change you change okay so letme just go ahead and print what theshootout but will be for this problemsure just make sure on something withthe question right so we would get 1 0 54 3 5 7 9 3 2 0 3 2 1 0 as the outputwhich is 1 yeah this is 6 this is 6that's right okay so I think anyspecific approach for his problem okayI'm thinking we should have like fourdifferent limits essentially I want Iwas top row and our end row and say fourcolumnsour income and then we can iterate fromcolumn start until comment and reduce Iwant roaster so remove this rowessentially and then it's rate from ourbarista to a row and then because weremoved one our end column will becomeour content a limit and then what'sreally from I'll comment to our commonstart index okay and so on all they wantare that be so the run that when I seethis I read own would be big-oh of nwe're in the number of elements in inthe matrix a centurywhat about the space capacity same forspace for my speakers up raising a youngangellist because good do you feelcommitted to start coding that yeah Ithink so can I go through I can someonecreate a your function using Python forthis problem let's just call it spiralthat's how you spell yeahso we're given a great matrix yeah we'vegot matrixand now we need to define our meanscreate our output list can just colorbalance just show to be short yeahand that one-city specify our limits forfocus problem so we'll have a row startyou know which will start at index ofzero maha-baho end which would be thelength of the matrix minus one thenwe'll have our constant which was thatvariable and our column end which wouldbe a length of the of the first row inour matrix a is 1so in this case they'll be 5-1 to beforeso now we'll see you create a while loopto iterate over this obvious naturesokay and okay set the condition for thewhile loop as while our row star is lessthan equals to you rent and our cornstar is less than pretty close to ourbecause to your commentthese rates over the matrix printing orhaving each other up a list so well Roystarts it has another close to Rowandand column start is N equals two columnn and that means to create the for forloops of iterating over this matrix soone from going to the right one forgoing down I feel left and one who areso we'll start with one we're going fromthis number to this number I know we'llbe going across the we're suffering thecolumn oh stop let me and we'll end atthe command so create a for loop for Iin range so we're going from commonstartsee comment and let me have one becauseoften it's actually and now we need toadd to our answer list to the answer theelements should I be matrix and we'regoing across the first row so that's therow start index and I so don't appendall the numbers in the first row but nowwe've traversed every so once youincrement our row start index rose toone so the roast out past equals oneokay so that means to go down from threeto seven so we could create a new forloop and we'll iterate from roast upthis time until around so leave for I inrange roast us see ruined plus 1 andthat will append the elements to ouranswer list I'll be matrix and we'llpass in the index of the first so was inheight and was specified to look at theend column columnso this is going to be going down hereyeah yeah yeah but now because withTraverse des when she remove this quotefrom from aliensso we'll decrement our column and sodoes another solution makes sense if Iyes sir from why I can understand so ifI were going all the way across on theright we've just gone down yeah that'scorrect and I mean to go from this pointto this point yeah but so because we'vedecreased our Comment and increased ouryou know when to double check if earlystart is still less than it goes to yourend and save a commentso we'll just check if row starts startsis less than equals to Rho end andcolumn start is this an equal to G :and in which case we can continue and[Music]create our third for you for I in rangeand that will be iterating over the lastrow and we'll stuff in content to Chromestart so we'll be and- column starts and minus 1 in this caseand we'll be commenting a visible timeso we might hear and will append thecount elements to our answer list soyou'll be on stop and matrix-matrix tobe on our endRoy so possibly next our friend and Ishould be the current and I column indexand finally we see increment niceeverything our row and solely right and- equals to 1 because we just we justgone free the last row you see andfinally we have 140 left which is goingfrom around to row startso the for I in range so row and shewrote starts that's 1 minus 1 and whatpendens to our answer listthe elements will be because in thecurrent index of the current row andpassing the current column start limitas reversing on the left so the columnstart and now we will see need toincrement our column startyeah thickness so good so then we canadjust return the list which would bethe own service that's that's mysolution sip to go for four lives onefor each direction that we can move inon each after each bullet we simply justmove the starting point of the row andthe column depending on which yeah sofor the first one loop iteration will gothrough this row this column was reallyand then we'll be left with theseelements in the middle quite here andwell begin our once again yeah what doesit give me the empty list so if the listis empty the will never be triggered Ibelieve because our end would be minusBill Gates rates he returned the answershould be empty listyes that's cool[Music]
