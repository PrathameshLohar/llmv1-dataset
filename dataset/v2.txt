over the last six years i've applied to hundreds of different job openings atapple out of those hundreds i wasselected to do an interview for ninedifferent positions i'll explain whatthe nine roles were for when iinterviewed for them and some of thelessons i learned from being rejectedthat way you can learn from theselessons and my mistakes so you don't getrejected yourself also i apologize fornot posting a youtube video these lastfew weeks it was build season at mystartup so i was busy working over 12hours a day managing the build of theserobots and even helping build some ofthese robots as well from scratch butthe engineering build is now done sohere's some more consistent uploads fromnow on anyways my journey at apple beganin the summer of 2018. i got aninterview for an audio pm internposition this was a program managementrole and back then i had no idea howtechnical apple interviews can be so ibombed it and the reason i got thatinterview was truly just because i hadone bullet point that mentioned programmanagement on my resume at the time andthat one bullet point really attractedthe apple recruiter which is why theychose to interview me like the wholeinterview was just them grilling me onthis one bullet point on my resume it'sinsane i then had a bit of a dry spellfor a while then in october of 2019 igot three interviews for three differentpositions at apple i remember that dayvery clearly because all threeinterviews were on monday october 7th2019 the day right before my birthdaythe interviews were all back to back soi was a little stressed from 10 30 to 11a.m i was interviewing for an appleiphone and watch product designinternship role then from 1 30 to 2 p.mi was interviewing for an applemechanical design and qualityengineering internship role then from 230 pm to 3 pm i was interviewing for anapple soft goods ipad product designinternship role now it's obviously alittle hard for me right now to talkabout the experience from well aboutthree years ago but luckily i had filmedthis video right after i completed theseinterviews of my initial thoughts hereis what tamer from three years ago hadto say about his first ever few appleinterviews today's october 72019i just i had three apple interviewstoday i was honestly so surreal havingthree apple interviews in one day i hopei get like the second interview i feellike i didn't get on the iphone productdesign one and that i have a progressionone but the mechanical design qualityengineering one man that was reallytough he asked me a lot of likesuper detailed stuff about projects i'veworked on in the past that i couldn'tanswer and i hopethat i actually do get eventually get ajob offer from for one of thesepositions and work at apple from januaryaugust 2020that's the goal uh so naiveunfortunately i didn't get a job offerfor any of these positions but that'sokay because fast forward to december of2019 i got another interview for anotherposition at apple this one was prettyexciting it was a product designengineering internship role for thespecial projects group or spg for shortat apple as the name implies is a teamat apple that works on super secretprojects but i think that team wouldhave been working on the apple car justbased on rumors i've read online aboutthe spg team at apple anywaysunfortunately that interview ended upbeing another rejection that's it forthe internship interviews i had withapple fast forward then to september of2020 i started applying to full-timeroles with apple because i would havebeen graduating in april of 2021 and ikind of just wanted to have somethinglined up in september of 2020 iinterviewed at apple for an engineeringproduct manager role on the team workingon siri they had me work on anassignment for them and that assignmenttook me a few days to complete i legitignored my schoolwork for those few daysand will just purely focus on doing thebest i can on that assignment i thensubmitted that assignment to therecruiter and again i put in a lot ofwork into that assignment the recruitersthat you'll get back to me within a weekif they're gonna be moving forward youknow i was pretty confident with thework i did in this assignment but 13 14days go by and i hear nothing from therecruiter so i decided you know let meemail her and see if they have an updatebut unfortunately they completelyghosted me and i never heard back fromthem since that one honestly kind ofhurt and from that experience i decidednot to apply to apple rolls for a whilefast forward to march of 2021 a friendof mine refers me to a full-time role atapple as an input devices product designengineer i was honestly not gonna dothat interview but honestly apple to meis kind of like a toxic x no matter whatyou can do you just can't get rid of itsometimes so i did a few interviews forthat position with a bunch of differentengineers on the team but to no surprisei was rejected and heartbroken onceagain then in september of 2021 i hadanother full-time interview for a smalldisplay mechanical engineering role atapple i got that interview through areferral as well i did a bunch ofinterviews for that position again witha bunch of different engineers on theteam but it ended up in anotherrejection finally in february of 2022 arecruiter reached out to me to interviewfor a full-time iphone and apple watchproduct design engineering role i didone interview with them but i wasactually happily employed at the time soi rejected them after all these years ofbeing rejected by them and it felt sogood so technically they rejected meeight times but i got the pleasure ofsaying no to them once at least but hereare seven things i learned from all myrejections at apple that can help youfrom being rejected if you choose toapply and work for apple first you mustunderstand your own resume very verywell every skill bullet point or projecton it needs to be extremely intentionalso if an interviewer asks you to explaina bullet point or a project on yourresume in a lot of detail you should beable to elaborate on it without anyhesitation at all i personally made thismistake before where i included bulletpoints on my resume that i couldn'treally elaborate on for example in oneof my failed apple interviews on myresume i talked about my experience withwelding honestly i didn't have a lot ofexperience with it but i was exposed toit so i just put it on my resume thatwas a mistake because in one of my appleinterviews the interviewer decided togrill me purely for 30 minutes on thatone welding bullet point so fair to sayi know why i wasn't successful in thatinterview since then i've learned thatwith every bullet point on my resume ineed to be able to talk about it andelaborate on it in more detail for atleast two to three minutes in aninterview situation i should be able toanswer questions about technical projectdetails how it came to fruition itssignificance etc if when you'repreparing for an interview there is abullet point that you're not really ableto elaborate on or explain in moredetail honestly you should just take itout of your resume because it's gonnacause you a huge headache later down theline when you're interviewing for appledoing so many interviews with apple istarted to pick up on some patterns thatthese interviewers tend to use theinterview process was almost alwaysbroken down into three stages theinitial stage was the tell me a buyyourself section the second stage wasthe project section and the third stagewas the technical interview section ofthe interview knowing this pattern ofhow these interviews are structured canhelp you prepare better for the tell meabout yourself section i have a one pagesummary of things that i always talkabout this includes a summary of my workexperience my schooling background aswell as a little bit of my interests inan interview situation it usually takesme about two to three minutes to givethem a quick summary about myself thisscript right here is basically what isay when someone asks me tell me aboutyourself i never really intended onmemorizing it but i just accidentallyhad it memorized because i've said it somany times in interviews if you chooseto go with a method like this and have ascript that you refer to just make surein an interview situation it doesn'tsound really rehearsed and memorized ithas to still sound natural next for theproject section i have a document wherei wrote down paragraphs about my mainprojects at work this is what it lookslike i also know the type of follow-upquestions i usually get asked ininterviews like why she metal or how iimplemented dfa so i have answers tothese questions as well third comes thetechnical questions section this is themost unpredictable part since you reallynever know what kind of technicalquestions the interviewer will choose toask you so what i'd recommend doing ishaving engineering summary notes of themain concepts that really relate to yourengineering major which brings me to mythird tip for mechanical engineering themain concepts i need to have a goodunderstanding of are mechanics ofdeformable solids material science gd tand manufacturing methods so i'd havethese handwritten and type notes thatsummarize everything i need to knowabout these four main topics the moreinterviews i do the more tough questionsi face which allows me to really knowwhat i don't know so i google it teachmyself and practice a little bit so inmy next interview i don't fail in thattechnical question the beauty of thisapproach is once you make these notesonce you can just quickly review thembefore each interview so your interviewprep becomes really quick andstraightforward again the purpose ofmaking these engineering summary notesis because it's a really quick andefficient way for a young engineer likeyou or myself to build their technicalexpertise as fast as we can you need toconvince the interviewer that you canthink like an engineer so when they askyou questions like explain how somethingis fabricated or explain why you chose aspecific material for a part you cananswer it correctly and provide proofthis is something that i never used todo i never used to practice before myinterviews i thought doing mockinterviews was a waste of time but i wasreally really wrong having a friendseriously sit down in front of you andpretend to be interviewing you for aserious job makes a huge differencethey'll give you honest feedback onwhat's not working they'll tell you ifyou said something in a weird waythey'll tell you if you're rambling orsaying things that don't make sense ifyou're not clearly explaining yourthought process they'll ideally let youknow as well just make sure that you'reboth serious and you're not just jokingaround this is not you guys hanging outtogether this is him or her seriouslysitting down and grilling you and givingyou tough interview questions and makesure to have them do a mock interviewwith you in the same format an interviewor would you know go through the tell meabout yourself then the project sectionand end it off with some prettydifficult technical questions trust methis is super super effective nowanother way to practice for interviewsis to film yourself answering interviewquestions sometimes in our head we thinkwe're making sense but once you filmyourself and you watch your own footageof you answering a question you realizeyou're actually just rambling on and notmaking any sense whatsoever so filmyourself answering questions like tellme about yourself explain this projecton your resume in more detail why didyou choose that specific material howdid you make sure your design isreliable explain the manufacturingprocess used in this project draw astress strain curve what's thedifference between injection molding anddie casting how do you calculate theflexion of a cantilever beam describehow you would improve the design of anairpod why is an i-beam stronger than arectangular beam describe three modes ofheat transfer and how they differ icould keep going on with an even longerlist of questions but anyways place yourphone on your desk turn the camera onand start answering these interviewquestions i know it may be awkward atfirst you may be a little shy but justforget that just hit record and starttalking this is just for you to getbetter and to clearly be able to seewhat your weaknesses are and again noone ever has to see this this is justfor you when you're interviewing for arole you should come prepared with yourpast work that you can share with theinterviewer they'll obviously definitelyask you questions about your past so youshould be able to show them picturesvideos or even prototypes of what you'vedone before take them through how theproject started what tools you needed tobuild it your thought process behindevery decision involved in the projectand what the final outcome was they'lldefinitely have follow-up questions andthey can be pretty confusing even thoughit's your project they'll make you feellike they know it better than youthey'll continuously grill you and askyou questions until you honestly can'teven answer anymore the way i get aroundthat is by slowing down and realizingit's my own project and i definitelyknow it better because i actually workedon it i answered their questions as bestas possible and if they had a follow-upquestion i couldn't answer then i'llmake a note of it and then i'll reviewit and try to figure it out after theinterview so i don't mess it up in thefuture in another interview sometimesthey honestly just grill you like thisbecause they want to see where yourlimit is the next step i have is to useglassdoor just google apple mechanicalengineering interview glassdoor orwhatever type of engineering you're inyou'll get access to a long list ofinterview questions that people haveshared from their experiencesinterviewing at apple they'll talk aboutwhat their experience was like andwhether they got an offer but what'smost important is you should compile alist of interview questions asked makesure you know how to answer them becausemost likely you'll get asked the exactsame questions in your interviewespecially when it comes to thetechnical questions aspect of theinterview moving on interviewing anapple isn't easy it's stressful andthey'll grill you a lot so to besuccessful and not lose your mind wheninterviewing for them you need to have aclear reason of why you even want towork at apple to begin with for exampleif you're reasoning for wanting to workat apples you want to be surrounded bythe best engineers in the consumerelectronics industry and you want towork with them then that's a decentenough reason that if you get rejectedyou wouldn't really lose hope as muchand please please please don't letrejection get to you or affect yourwell-being you're worth more than a jobat the end of the day is usually nothingpersonal it's just a sign that you havea lot more to learn with every rejectiontry to figure out why you got rejectedthen fill in these knowledge gaps soyou're stronger in your next futureinterviews anyways i hope this videobrought you value if it did check outthis video where i reenact whatengineering interviews are like or checkout that video where i share some of thethings that every engineering studentneeds to know before starting anywaysi'll see you the next one peace
