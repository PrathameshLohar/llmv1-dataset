look at and a bunch of tipsfor each round quick intro I'm from prepfor lit this video has been put togetherby Apple iOS Engineers who are alsointerview coaches on prep Philly thevery same ones who have helped hundredsof candidates with mock interviews andadvice this is a video version of a muchmore in-depth written guide which we'lllink within the description you canalways book time directly with thecoaches for a more personalizedexperience on prep Philly okay thenmoving on to the interview the interviewprocess for an Apple iOS engineertypically consists of three rounds firsta video call with the hiring managernext a technical phone screen andfinally an on-site round which lastsroughly six hours let's discuss eachround briefly starting with the firstvideo call with the hiring manager thisone is typically a character-based roundwhere you talk about your pastexperience your interviewers are alsointerested in learning if you areknowledgeable about Apple's developmentFrameworks and

tothe third and final round on site ittypically lasts around six hours duringwhich you will face a bunch ofinterviews across three separateinterviews the algorithm beta structureiOS system design behavioral let'sdiscuss each briefly three quick tipshere practice solving coding problemsusing online resources such as leap codeor hacker rank brush up on yourknowledge of Swift or object-seeprogramming languages as you write yourcode on a whiteboard or in an onlineeditor make sure to explain your thoughtprocess throughout and collaborate withyour interviewers for the best resultsnext up the behavioral round which is totest your ability to handle conflicts orchallenges in a team setting and judgeyour interpersonal skills again threetips here make sure you think ahead

conditions so that you candeliver concise effective responsesanother tip is to research Apple'scultures and values and try aligningyour responses with them finally there'sthe system Design Round it's importantto note the iOS system design interviewis a bit different from traditionalbackend Focus system design theinterview you'll face will be much moreapp focused than backend focused so it'sworth investing into preparing for themyour interviewer is trying to understandyour ability to solve a complicated iOSengineering design problem or in otherwords can you architect a high levelsolution to a problem that has multipleConcepts and components ideally you'llcover a range of topics that are goingto prove relevant in the actual job TheView layer the networking storage cashEtc the three things they arespecifically looking for are technicalskills structure and approach andcommunication and collaboration skillswe have five tips this is the mostcritical part of this video scope andclarifier this is maybe the mostcritical one since these questions aresuper Broad and you want to narrowdefinitions down into something you canactually attack in the 40 minutes or soyou have it also has a major sidebenefit in that it lets experts choosewhich areas they want to focus on sincethey'll have a short list of things toassess you again good questions to thinkabouthow many users are we talking about whatshould the experience be while you'rewaiting for your confirmation what someof the error States might be what arethe latency requirements for senderreceiver message delivery how are yougoing to store messages and if there areany constraints around it what kind offeatures are we going to need to supportthe MVP have a structure and methodicalapproach my general recommendation is tosplit things into discrete layersstarting from the view controllernetwork storage cache since that's howyou design a system in real life andthen Within These discuss Concepts likeperformance efficiency and scale as wellas potentially product specific nuanceslike time zones or Scrolls oraccessibility which brings me on to mythird tip watch out for hints let megive you an example maybe you'redesigning some kind of calendar elementand your interviewer asks are you sureyou're just like a simple time stamp forthis event this is an explicit hint thatyou might be missing something May maybeyou should be storing a start time andan end time or maybe there's somecomplexity related to time zones orsomething use this as an opportunity toeither pivot or clarify or explain yourthinking which neatly flows over into myfourth tip think out loud you're solvinga problem and it's super useful for yourinterviewer to know how you'reapproaching it and even more so for yousince they can course correct if you'regoing down the wrong tangent or a linethat they're not interested infinally the practice practice withprofessionals prep Philly has 18 iOSEngineers who help candidates with mocksthey've collectively helped over
